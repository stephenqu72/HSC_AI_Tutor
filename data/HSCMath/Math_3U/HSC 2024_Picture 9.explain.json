  "Detailed_Explanation": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two coins drawn at random from a bag are made of the same metal. The bag contains \\(n\\) coins, of which \\(k\\) are silver and \\(n-k\\) are bronze. The probability can be calculated by considering the two scenarios where the two coins drawn are either both silver or both bronze, and then summing these probabilities.\n\n1. **Probability that both coins are silver**: The probability of drawing a silver coin first is \\(\\frac{k}{n}\\), and the probability of drawing another silver coin after the first one is drawn (without replacement) is \\(\\frac{k-1}{n-1}\\). Therefore, the probability of both coins being silver is \\(\\frac{k}{n} \\times \\frac{k-1}{n-1}\\).\n\n2. **Probability that both coins are bronze**: The probability of drawing a bronze coin first is \\(\\frac{n-k}{n}\\), and the probability of drawing another bronze coin after the first one is drawn (without replacement) is \\(\\frac{n-k-1}{n-1}\\). Therefore, the probability of both coins being bronze is \\(\\frac{n-k}{n} \\times \\frac{n-k-1}{n-1}\\).\n\nThe total probability that the two coins drawn are made of the same metal is the sum of these two probabilities:\n\\[\\frac{k(k-1)}{n(n-1)} + \\frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{n(n-1)} = \\frac{k(k-1) + (n-k)(n-k-1)}{n(n-1)}\\]",
  "Others": "This problem involves basic probability concepts and the use of combinations to calculate probabilities. It is a good example of how to handle scenarios where items are drawn without replacement from a finite population."
