  "Detailed_Explanation": "To solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 8x - 9 = 0$, we can use the method of factoring. The goal is to express the quadratic expression as a product of two binomials. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation: $a = 1$, $b = -8$, and $c = -9$.\n2. Find two numbers that multiply to $ac = 1 \times -9 = -9$ and add up to $b = -8$. These numbers are $-9$ and $1$.\n3. Rewrite the middle term $-8x$ as $-9x + x$.\n4. Factor by grouping: $x^2 - 9x + x - 9 = 0$.\n5. Group the terms: $(x^2 - 9x) + (x - 9) = 0$.\n6. Factor out the common terms: $x(x - 9) + 1(x - 9) = 0$.\n7. Factor out the common binomial $(x - 9)$: $(x - 9)(x + 1) = 0$.\n8. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$: $x - 9 = 0$ or $x + 1 = 0$.\n9. The solutions are $x = 9$ and $x = -1$.\n\nThis method is a fundamental technique in solving quadratic equations and is covered in the HSC Mathematics syllabus under the topic of algebraic techniques.",
  "Others": "It's important to note that the quadratic formula can also be used to solve the equation, but factoring is often the preferred method for simple quadratic equations. The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, which can be applied to any quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. However, factoring is more efficient for equations where the quadratic expression can be easily factored."
