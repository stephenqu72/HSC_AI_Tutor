  "Detailed_Explanation": "This problem requires a clear understanding of function transformations, specifically `f(|x|)` and `1/f(x)`. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n**1. Analyze the original function `y = f(x)`:**\n   *   The graph shows `f(x)` is defined for `x > 0`.\n   *   It has a vertical asymptote at `x = 0`, where `f(x) \\to -\\infty` as `x \\to 0^+`.\n   *   It crosses the x-axis at `x = 1`, meaning `f(1) = 0`.\n   *   `f(x)` is negative for `0 < x < 1`.\n   *   `f(x)` is positive for `x > 1`.\n   *   `f(x)` is an increasing function.\n   *   As `x \\to \\infty`, `f(x) \\to \\infty`.\n\n**2. Transformation to `y = f(|x|)`:**\n   The transformation `f(|x|)` means we keep the part of `f(x)` for `x \\ge 0` and reflect it across the y-axis to obtain the graph for `x < 0`. This makes the function symmetric about the y-axis (an even function). The key features of `y = f(|x|)` will be:\n   *   Vertical asymptote at `x = 0`, where `f(|x|) \\to -\\infty` as `x \\to 0` (from both sides).\n   *   X-intercepts at `x = -1` and `x = 1` (since `f(1) = 0`, then `f(|x|) = 0` when `|x|=1`).\n   *   `f(|x|)` is negative for `0 < |x| < 1` (i.e., `-1 < x < 0` and `0 < x < 1`).\n   *   `f(|x|)` is positive for `|x| > 1` (i.e., `x < -1` and `x > 1`).\n   *   As `|x| \\to \\infty`, `f(|x|) \\to \\infty`.\n\n**3. Transformation to `y = \\frac{1}{f(|x|)}` (Reciprocal Function):**\n   Now, let's form the reciprocal function from `y = f(|x|)`. Remember the rules for reciprocal graphs:\n   *   **Vertical Asymptotes:** Occur where `f(|x|) = 0`. From Step 2, `f(|x|) = 0` at `x = -1` and `x = 1`. Thus, `y = \\frac{1}{f(|x|)}` will have vertical asymptotes at `x = -1` and `x = 1`.\n   *   **Horizontal Asymptotes:** As `|x| \\to \\infty`, `f(|x|) \\to \\infty`. Therefore, `\\frac{1}{f(|x|)} \\to 0`. This means `y = 0` (the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote.\n   *   **Behavior at `x = 0`:** As `x \\to 0`, `f(|x|) \\to -\\infty`. Therefore, `\\frac{1}{f(|x|)} \\to 0` from the negative side (i.e., `y` approaches `0` from below the x-axis). Since `f(0)` is undefined (as is `f(|x|)` at `x=0`), `\\frac{1}{f(|x|)}` is also undefined at `x=0`. This will be represented by an open circle at `(0,0)`.\n   *   **Sign of the function:**\n      *   Where `f(|x|)` is positive (for `|x| > 1`), `\\frac{1}{f(|x|)}` will be positive.\n      *   Where `f(|x|)` is negative (for `0 < |x| < 1`), `\\frac{1}{f(|x|)}` will be negative.\n\n**4. Evaluate the options:**\n   Let's compare these derived features with the given options:\n   *   **Option A:**\n      *   Has vertical asymptotes at `x = -1` and `x = 1`. (Correct)\n      *   Has a horizontal asymptote at `y = 0`. (Correct)\n      *   The graph is positive for `|x| > 1`. (Correct)\n      *   The graph is negative for `0 < |x| < 1`. (Correct)\n      *   The graph approaches `(0,0)` from below, with an open circle at the origin. The steepness of the curves approaching `x=0` from both sides (as `1/ln|x|` would, for example) is consistent. (Correct)\n      *   The overall shape reflects the reciprocal nature, where segments go from approaching `\\infty` or `-\\infty` near vertical asymptotes to approaching `0` near horizontal asymptotes, and vice-versa.\n\n   *   **Option B:** This graph clearly represents `y = f(|x|)` itself, not its reciprocal. It has a vertical asymptote at `x=0` and passes through `(-1,0)` and `(1,0)`. (Incorrect)\n\n   *   **Option C:** While it shares many features with Option A (VAs at `x=\\pm 1`, HA at `y=0`, correct signs in intervals), the behavior at `x=0` is problematic. The graph seems to meet at `(0,0)` in a rounded fashion, suggesting `y(0)=0` and a cusp, which is inconsistent with `\\frac{1}{f(|x|)}` being undefined at `x=0` and approaching `0` with steep tangents. The open circle and the steeper approach in Option A are more accurate for the function approaching `0` from negative y-values at `x=0`.\n\n   *   **Option D:** This graph has a vertical asymptote at `x=0`, which is incorrect for `\\frac{1}{f(|x|)}`. The vertical asymptotes should be at `x = \\pm 1`. (Incorrect)\n\nTherefore, Option A is the best representation of `y = \\frac{1}{f(|x|)}`.\n",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I'd emphasise the importance of breaking down complex transformations into simpler steps. First, tackle the inner transformation (like `f(|x|)`), and then the outer one (like `1/g(x)`). Pay close attention to:\n\n1.  **Domain and Range**: How do transformations affect where the function is defined?\n2.  **Asymptotes**: Identify vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the original function and how they transform.\n3.  **Intercepts**: How do x- and y-intercepts transform?\n4.  **Sign of the function**: Which regions are positive/negative?\n5.  **Behavior near critical points**: What happens as `x` approaches an asymptote or an intercept? This often determines the 'shape' near these points.\n\nFor reciprocal functions, remember these key properties:\n*   Zeros of the original function become vertical asymptotes of the reciprocal.\n*   Vertical asymptotes of the original function become zeros of the reciprocal.\n*   `y = \\pm 1` points on the original graph remain invariant (i.e., `1/1 = 1`, `1/-1 = -1`).\n*   The sign of the function does not change (positive values remain positive, negative values remain negative).\n*   If the original function approaches `\\pm \\infty`, the reciprocal approaches `0`.\n*   If the original function approaches `0`, the reciprocal approaches `\\pm \\infty`.\n\nPracticing with specific examples like `f(x) = \\ln(x)` (which closely resembles the given `f(x)`) and applying these transformations can build strong intuition for these types of questions, which are common in HSC Advanced and Extension 1 Maths."
