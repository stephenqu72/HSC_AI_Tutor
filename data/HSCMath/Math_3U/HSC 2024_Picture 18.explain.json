  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question requires us to apply the condition for two vectors being perpendicular, which is that their dot product is equal to zero.\n\nLet the two given vectors be $\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} a+5 \\\\ a-4 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the condition for perpendicular vectors.**\nTwo vectors $\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero. The dot product is calculated as $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the dot product of the given vectors.**\nApplying the dot product formula to our vectors:\n$$ \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = (a^2)(a+5) + (2)(a-4) $$\n\n**Step 3: Set the dot product to zero and form an equation.**\nSince the vectors are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero:\n$$ (a^2)(a+5) + (2)(a-4) = 0 $$\n\n**Step 4: Expand and simplify the equation.**\nExpand the terms:\n$$ a^3 + 5a^2 + 2a - 8 = 0 $$\nThis is a cubic equation.\n\n**Step 5: Solve the cubic equation.**\nTo solve a cubic equation like this, we can first look for integer roots using the Factor Theorem. If $a=k$ is a root, then $(a-k)$ is a factor of the polynomial. We test factors of the constant term (-8), which are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8$.\n\n*   Test $a=1$:\n    $$(1)^3 + 5(1)^2 + 2(1) - 8 = 1 + 5 + 2 - 8 = 0$$\n    Since substituting $a=1$ makes the equation true, $a=1$ is a root. This means $(a-1)$ is a factor of the polynomial.\n\n*   Use polynomial division (or synthetic division) to divide $a^3 + 5a^2 + 2a - 8$ by $(a-1)$.\n    Using synthetic division:\n    ```\n    1 | 1   5   2   -8\n      |     1   6    8\n      ----------------\n        1   6   8    0\n    ```\n    This gives us a quotient of $a^2 + 6a + 8$.\n\n    So, the equation can be factored as:\n    $$ (a-1)(a^2 + 6a + 8) = 0 $$\n\n*   Now, we need to solve the quadratic equation $a^2 + 6a + 8 = 0$.\n    We look for two numbers that multiply to 8 and add to 6. These numbers are 2 and 4.\n    So, the quadratic factors as:\n    $$ (a+2)(a+4) = 0 $$\n\n*   Combine all factors:\n    $$ (a-1)(a+2)(a+4) = 0 $$\n\n**Step 6: Determine the possible values of $a$.**\nFor the product of factors to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero:\n*   $a-1 = 0 \\Rightarrow a = 1$\n*   $a+2 = 0 \\Rightarrow a = -2$\n*   $a+4 = 0 \\Rightarrow a = -4$\n\nThus, the possible values of $a$ are $1, -2,$ and $-4$.",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I'd emphasize that this question tests a fundamental concept in Vectors: the dot product and its geometric interpretation for perpendicularity. This is a common type of question, often appearing in the initial parts of a longer question on vectors. Here are some key takeaways and common pitfalls:\n\n1.  **Recall the Dot Product Definition:** Ensure students clearly remember that for 2D vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ y_1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\\\ y_2 \\end{pmatrix}$, the dot product is $x_1x_2 + y_1y_2$. This extends to 3D similarly.\n2.  **Perpendicularity Condition:** The most crucial point is that $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$ if and only if $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are perpendicular (assuming non-zero vectors).\n3.  **Algebraic Skills:** This question quickly turns into an algebra problem once the vector concept is applied. Students need solid skills in:\n    *   Expanding algebraic expressions (e.g., $(a^2)(a+5)$).\n    *   Solving polynomial equations, particularly cubic equations. For cubic equations, the Factor Theorem (testing factors of the constant term) and polynomial division (or synthetic division) are essential techniques.\n    *   Factoring quadratic expressions.\n4.  **Show All Steps:** Even for a 3-mark question, clearly showing the setup of the dot product, the resulting equation, and the steps to solve it helps secure full marks and allows for partial credit if an algebraic error occurs.\n5.  **Check for 'extraneous' solutions:** While not an issue in this specific problem (all roots of the cubic are valid), it's good practice to always consider if any obtained solutions might be invalid in the context of the original problem (e.g., dividing by zero, square roots of negative numbers, domain restrictions). In this case, no such restrictions apply.\n\nThis question is a good indicator of a student's foundational understanding of vector properties and their algebraic proficiency, which are both crucial for success in the HSC Mathematics Extension 1 and Extension 2 courses."
