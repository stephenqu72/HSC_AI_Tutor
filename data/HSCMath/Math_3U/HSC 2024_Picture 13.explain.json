  "Answer": "To solve the integral \\(\\int x\\sqrt{x-1} dx\\) using the substitution \\(u = x - 1\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. Substitute \\(u = x - 1\\), so \\(x = u + 1\\).\n2. Differentiate both sides with respect to \\(x\\): \\(du = dx\\).\n3. Substitute \\(x = u + 1\\) and \\(dx = du\\) into the integral: \\(\\int (u + 1)\\sqrt{u} du\\).\n4. Simplify the integral: \\(\\int (u^{3/2} + u^{1/2}) du\\).\n5. Integrate term by term: \\(\\frac{2}{5}u^{5/2} + \\frac{2}{3}u^{3/2} + C\\).\n6. Substitute back \\(u = x - 1\\): \\(\\frac{2}{5}(x - 1)^{5/2} + \\frac{2}{3}(x - 1)^{3/2} + C\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution is: \\(\\int x\\sqrt{x-1} dx = \\frac{2}{5}(x - 1)^{5/2} + \\frac{2}{3}(x - 1)^{3/2} + C\\).",

  "Detailed_Explanation": "This problem involves integration by substitution, a key technique in calculus. The substitution method is used to simplify the integral by changing the variable of integration. Here, we substitute \\(u = x - 1\\) to transform the integral into a simpler form. This substitution helps in dealing with the square root term, which is often difficult to integrate directly. The integral is then solved by applying the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of \\(x^n\\) is \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\\) for \\(n \\neq -1\\). After integrating, we substitute back the original variable \\(x\\) to express the solution in terms of the original variable.",
  "Others": "This problem is a good example of how substitution can simplify complex integrals. It is a common technique in calculus and is often covered in HSC mathematics syllabuses. The solution involves basic algebra and the power rule for integration, which are fundamental skills in calculus."
