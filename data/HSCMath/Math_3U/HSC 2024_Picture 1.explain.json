  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question requires knowledge of the relationship between the roots and coefficients of a polynomial, specifically Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, with roots $r_1, r_2, r_3$, the following relationships hold:\n\n1.  **Sum of the roots**: $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -b/a$\n2.  **Sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time**: $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = c/a$\n3.  **Product of the roots**: $r_1r_2r_3 = -d/a$\n\nGiven the polynomial $x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 6$, we can identify the coefficients:\n$a = 1$\n$b = 2$\n$c = -5$\n$d = -6$\n\nThe zeros (roots) are given as $-1$, $-3$, and $\\alpha$.\n\nWe can use any of the Vieta's formulas, but the product of roots or the sum of roots formulas are usually the quickest when only one root is unknown.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Product of Roots Formula**\nThe product of the roots is $r_1r_2r_3 = -d/a$.\nSubstituting the known values:\n$(-1) \\times (-3) \\times \\alpha = -(-6)/1$\n$3\\alpha = 6$\n$\\alpha = 6/3$\n$\\alpha = 2$\n\n**Method 2: Using the Sum of Roots Formula**\nThe sum of the roots is $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -b/a$.\nSubstituting the known values:\n$(-1) + (-3) + \\alpha = -(2)/1$\n$-4 + \\alpha = -2$\n$\\alpha = -2 + 4$\n$\\alpha = 2$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, $\\alpha = 2$.\nTherefore, the value of $\\alpha$ is 2, which corresponds to option B.",
  "Others": "As an HSC student, mastering Vieta's formulas for cubic (and quadratic) polynomials is crucial. This type of question is a standard application and often appears in multiple-choice sections. Always double-check your calculations, especially with negative signs. While both the sum and product of roots formulas work, often one might be computationally simpler than the other depending on the coefficients and known roots. For instance, if 'd' or 'b' were zero, it might simplify things. Remember, you could also use the Factor Theorem. Since -1 and -3 are roots, $(x+1)$ and $(x+3)$ are factors. You could divide the polynomial by $(x+1)(x+3) = x^2+4x+3$ to find the remaining linear factor $(x-2)$, from which $\\alpha=2$ is the root. However, this is generally more time-consuming than applying Vieta's formulas for this specific question."
