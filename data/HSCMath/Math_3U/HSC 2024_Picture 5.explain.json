  "Detailed_Explanation": "To determine the transformations applied to $f(x) = \\sin^{-1}(x)$ to obtain $g(x) = 2 \\sin^{-1}(3x)$, we need to understand the general form of function transformations.\n\nThe general form of a transformed function is often written as $y = A f(B(x-C)) + D$.\n\nIn our case, we have:\nOriginal function: $f(x) = \\sin^{-1}(x)$\nTransformed function: $g(x) = 2 \\sin^{-1}(3x)$\n\nLet's compare the structure of $g(x)$ with $f(x)$ to identify the transformations.\n\n1.  **Vertical Dilation:**\n    A factor outside the main function, like $A$ in $A f(x)$, causes a vertical dilation. If $A > 1$, it's a stretch; if $0 < A < 1$, it's a compression. If $A < 0$, it also includes a reflection across the x-axis.\n    In $g(x) = 2 \\sin^{-1}(3x)$, the number $2$ is multiplying the entire $\\sin^{-1}(3x)$ term. This means the $y$-values of the original function are multiplied by $2$.\n    Therefore, there is a **vertical dilation (stretch) by a factor of 2**.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Dilation:**\n    A factor inside the function, multiplying $x$ (like $B$ in $f(Bx)$), causes a horizontal dilation. It's important to remember that this dilation is by a factor of $1/B$, not $B$. If $B > 1$, it's a horizontal compression; if $0 < B < 1$, it's a horizontal stretch. If $B < 0$, it also includes a reflection across the y-axis.\n    In $g(x) = 2 \\sin^{-1}(3x)$, the number $3$ is multiplying $x$ inside the $\\sin^{-1}$ function, i.e., $f(3x)$. According to the rule, the horizontal dilation factor is $1/3$.\n    Therefore, there is a **horizontal dilation (compression) by a factor of $1/3$**.\n\nCombining these two transformations:\n*   Vertical dilation by a factor of 2.\n*   Horizontal dilation by a factor of $1/3$.\n\nNow, let's check the given options:\n*   A. Vertical dilation by a factor of $1/2$ and a horizontal dilation by a factor of $1/3$. (Incorrect vertical dilation)\n*   B. Vertical dilation by a factor of $1/2$ and a horizontal dilation by a factor of 3. (Incorrect vertical and horizontal dilation)\n*   C. Vertical dilation by a factor of 2 and a horizontal dilation by a factor of $1/3$. (Correct)\n*   D. Vertical dilation by a factor of 2 and a horizontal dilation by a factor of 3. (Incorrect horizontal dilation)\n\nThe correct option is C.",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I'd strongly advise students to remember the general transformation rules:\n*   $y = A f(x)$: Vertical dilation by factor $A$.\n*   $y = f(Bx)$: Horizontal dilation by factor $1/B$.\n*   $y = f(x-C)$: Horizontal translation by $C$ units (right if $C>0$, left if $C<0$).\n*   $y = f(x) + D$: Vertical translation by $D$ units (up if $D>0$, down if $D<0$).\n\nIt's a common mistake to think the horizontal dilation factor is $B$ rather than $1/B$. Always remember that transformations 'inside' the function (affecting $x$) often act counter-intuitively to the coefficient value. For example, $f(2x)$ makes the graph 'squish' horizontally (compressed), so values must be divided by 2 to get the same $x$ coordinate.\n\nAlso, a good practice is to consider the domain and range changes. For $f(x) = \\sin^{-1}(x)$:\n*   Domain: $[-1, 1]$ (i.e., $-1 \\le x \\le 1$)\n*   Range: $[-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$ (i.e., $-\\pi/2 \\le y \\le \\pi/2$)\n\nFor $g(x) = 2 \\sin^{-1}(3x)$:\n*   **Domain:** The argument $3x$ must be within the domain of $\\sin^{-1}(u)$, so $-1 \\le 3x \\le 1$. Dividing by 3 gives $-1/3 \\le x \\le 1/3$. This is a horizontal compression by a factor of $1/3$.\n*   **Range:** The $y$-values of $\\sin^{-1}(3x)$ are in $[-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$. Multiplying by $2$ gives $2 \times [-\\pi/2, \\pi/2] = [-\\pi, \\pi]$. This is a vertical stretch by a factor of $2$.\n\nThese changes in domain and range are consistent with our identified dilations, confirming the answer."
