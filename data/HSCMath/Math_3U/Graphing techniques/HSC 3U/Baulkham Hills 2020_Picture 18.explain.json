  "Answer": "(i) The graph of $y = f(|x|)$ is obtained by retaining the part of the original graph $y=f(x)$ for $x \\ge 0$ and reflecting this part across the y-axis. This results in a graph that is symmetrical about the y-axis, with a minimum at $x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$ and y-intercept $(0,1)$. The graph approaches the horizontal asymptote $y=2$ as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. \n\n(ii) The graph of $y^2 = f(x)$ is obtained by considering $y = \\pm\\sqrt{f(x)}$. The graph only exists where $f(x) \\ge 0$. The part of the original graph for $x < -1$ (where $f(x) < 0$) is discarded. For $x \\in (-1, 0]$ and $x \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$, where $f(x) \\ge 0$, two corresponding y-values exist: $y = \\sqrt{f(x)}$ and $y = -\\sqrt{f(x)}$.

  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question tests your understanding of graph transformations, a crucial topic in HSC Advanced Mathematics. Let's break down each part:\n\n**Understanding the Original Graph `y = f(x)`:**\nFirst, carefully identify the key features of the given graph $y=f(x)$:\n*   **Y-intercept:** $(0, 1)$\n*   **X-intercept:** $(\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$\n*   **Vertical Asymptote:** $x = -1$\n*   **Horizontal Asymptote:** $y = 2$ (as $x \\to \\infty$)\n*   **Shape:** For $x < -1$, the graph is below the x-axis, approaching $x=-1$ from the left. For $-1 < x \\le 0$, the graph approaches $x=-1$ from the right and goes through $(0,1)$. For $0 < x \\le \\frac{1}{2}$, it's a straight line from $(0,1)$ to $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$. For $x > \\frac{1}{2}$, it's a curve starting at $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$ and approaching $y=2$ from below.\n\n**(i) Sketch of $y = f(|x|)$**\nThis transformation means that for any $x$-value, the $y$-value will be the same as the $y$-value for the positive version of that $x$. \n*   **Rule:**\n    1.  **Discard the part of the graph for $x < 0$** (the left-hand side of the y-axis) from the original $y=f(x)$.\n    2.  **Keep the part of the graph for $x \\ge 0$** (the right-hand side of the y-axis) as it is.\n    3.  **Reflect the retained part (from $x \\ge 0$) across the y-axis** to create the graph for $x < 0$.\n*   **Application to this specific graph:**\n    *   The portion of $f(x)$ for $x \\ge 0$ consists of the line segment from $(0,1)$ to $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$ and the curve from $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$ approaching the horizontal asymptote $y=2$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n    *   Reflecting this across the y-axis:\n        *   The point $(0,1)$ remains $(0,1)$.\n        *   The x-intercept $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$ reflects to $(-\\frac{1}{2},0)$.\n        *   The line segment from $(0,1)$ to $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$ reflects to a line segment from $(0,1)$ to $(-\\frac{1}{2},0)$.\n        *   The curve for $x > \\frac{1}{2}$ approaching $y=2$ reflects to a similar curve for $x < -\\frac{1}{2}$ approaching $y=2$ as $x \\to -\\infty$.\n*   **Resulting Graph Features:**\n    *   Symmetrical about the y-axis.\n    *   Y-intercept: $(0,1)$.\n    *   X-intercepts: $(-\\frac{1}{2},0)$ and $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$.\n    *   Horizontal Asymptote: $y=2$ (as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$).\n    *   The vertical asymptote at $x=-1$ from the original function is removed because the $x < 0$ part of $f(x)$ is discarded.\n\n**(ii) Sketch of $y^2 = f(x)$**\nThis transformation is equivalent to $y = \\pm \\sqrt{f(x)}$. This implies two key rules:\n*   **Domain Restriction:** The graph only exists where $f(x) \\ge 0$, because we cannot take the square root of a negative number in real coordinates.\n*   **Symmetry:** For every point $(x,y_0)$ on $y = \\sqrt{f(x)}$, there will be a corresponding point $(x,-y_0)$ on $y = -\\sqrt{f(x)}$. This means the graph will be symmetrical about the x-axis.\n\n*   **Application to this specific graph:**\n    *   **Identify where $f(x) \\ge 0$:** From the original graph, $f(x) < 0$ for $x < -1$. So, the portion of the graph for $x < -1$ must be discarded.\n    *   The graph for $y^2 = f(x)$ will exist for $x \\in (-1, 0] \\cup [\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty)$.\n    *   **For $-1 < x \\le 0$:**\n        *   In this interval, $f(x)$ ranges from very large positive values (as $x \\to -1^+$) down to $1$ (at $x=0$).\n        *   Therefore, $y = \\pm \\sqrt{f(x)}$ will range from very large positive/negative values (as $x \\to -1^+$) down to $\\pm \\sqrt{1} = \\pm 1$ (at $x=0$).\n        *   This creates two branches: one in the first quadrant approaching $x=-1$ and reaching $(0,1)$, and one in the fourth quadrant approaching $x=-1$ and reaching $(0,-1)$.\n        *   **Vertical Asymptote:** $x=-1$ remains a vertical asymptote, but the graph approaches it from both above and below for $x > -1$.\n    *   **For $x = \\frac{1}{2}$:**\n        *   $f(\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$. So, $y = \\pm \\sqrt{0} = 0$. The x-intercept $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$ is preserved.\n    *   **For $x > \\frac{1}{2}$:**\n        *   In this interval, $f(x)$ ranges from $0$ (at $x=\\frac{1}{2}$) approaching $2$ (as $x \\to \\infty$).\n        *   Therefore, $y = \\pm \\sqrt{f(x)}$ will range from $0$ (at $x=\\frac{1}{2}$) approaching $\\pm \\sqrt{2}$ (as $x \\to \\infty$).\n        *   This creates two branches: one in the first quadrant starting at $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$ and approaching $y=\\sqrt{2}$, and one in the fourth quadrant starting at $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$ and approaching $y=-\\sqrt{2}$.\n        *   **Horizontal Asymptotes:** $y=\\sqrt{2}$ and $y=-\\sqrt{2}$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n*   **Resulting Graph Features:**\n    *   Symmetrical about the x-axis.\n    *   X-intercept: $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$.\n    *   Y-intercepts: $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$.\n    *   Vertical Asymptote: $x=-1$ (approached from the right side for both upper and lower branches).\n    *   Horizontal Asymptotes: $y=\\sqrt{2}$ and $y=-\\sqrt{2}$ (as $x \\to \\infty$).\n    *   No graph for $x < -1$.\n\nWhen sketching, ensure all key points (intercepts, minimums/maximums, points of intersection, endpoints) and asymptotic behaviour are clearly indicated. Labels on axes and asymptotes are also crucial for full marks.",
  "Others": "As an HSC Maths teacher, here are some critical tips for graph transformation questions:\n\n1.  **Know Your Rules Cold:** There are about 6-8 standard graph transformations ($f(x)+c$, $f(x+c)$, $cf(x)$, $f(cx)$, $|f(x)|$, $f(|x|)$, $y^2=f(x)$). You must know the effect of each one perfectly. Practice drawing a basic function and applying each transformation.\n2.  **Focus on Key Features:** Don't try to redraw every detail of the curve perfectly. Instead, identify the crucial points: intercepts, asymptotes (vertical, horizontal, oblique), turning points, endpoints, and points of inflection. Apply the transformation rules to these specific features first.\n3.  **Step-by-Step Approach:** For complex transformations, break them down. For example, if asked for $y = |f(x+1)|$, first sketch $y = f(x+1)$, then apply the absolute value transformation. For this question, parts (i) and (ii) are distinct transformations.\n4.  **Domain and Range are Crucial (especially for $y^2 = f(x)$):** The `y = +/- sqrt(f(x))` transformation immediately tells you that the graph only exists where $f(x) \\ge 0$. This is a common trap for students who forget to restrict the domain. For $f(|x|)$, the domain for $x$ changes, but the range is determined by the range of $f(x)$ for $x \\ge 0$.\n5.  **Label Everything:** Axes ($x, y, O$), intercepts (with numerical values), and asymptotes (with their equations, e.g., $x=-1$, $y=2$) must be clearly labelled. This shows you understand the transformed graph's properties.\n6.  **Use Dashed Lines for Asymptotes:** Always use dashed lines for asymptotes to distinguish them from the actual curve.\n7.  **Symmetry:** Pay close attention to how transformations like $f(|x|)$ (y-axis symmetry) and $y^2 = f(x)$ (x-axis symmetry) affect the graph. This is a quick check to see if your sketch is plausible.\n8.  **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The best way to master these is by repeatedly drawing various transformations of different parent functions. Get comfortable with parabolas, hyperbolas, exponentials, logarithms, and trig functions under transformation.\n\nGood luck with your HSC! Mastering graph transformations will build a strong foundation for Calculus and other higher-level topics."
