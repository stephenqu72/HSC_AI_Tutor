  "Answer": "Here are the sketches for the transformed graphs:\n\n**(i) Sketch of y = f(|x|)**\nTo sketch y = f(|x|), we follow these steps:\n1.  Retain the portion of the graph of y = f(x) where x ≥ 0.\n2.  For the portion where x < 0, replace it with the reflection of the graph for x > 0 across the y-axis.\n\nKey features of y = f(|x|):\n*   **y-intercept:** Remains (0, 2).\n*   **x-intercepts:** The original graph had x-intercepts at (1, 0) and (3, 0). After reflection, new x-intercepts will appear at (-1, 0) and (-3, 0). So, y = f(|x|) has x-intercepts at x = -3, -1, 1, 3.\n*   **Symmetry:** The graph is now symmetric about the y-axis, meaning it is an even function.\n*   **Local minimum:** The original local minimum between x=1 and x=3 (approximately (2, -0.67)) will be mirrored to another local minimum at approximately (-2, -0.67).\n\n**(ii) Sketch of y = 1/f(x)**\nTo sketch y = 1/f(x), we consider the reciprocal of the y-values of y = f(x):\n1.  **Vertical Asymptotes (VA):** Wherever f(x) = 0, y = 1/f(x) will have a vertical asymptote. From the original graph, f(x) = 0 at x = 1 and x = 3. So, there are VAs at x = 1 and x = 3.\n2.  **y-intercept:** The original y-intercept is (0, 2). For y = 1/f(x), the y-intercept will be (0, 1/2).\n3.  **Local extrema:** A local minimum of f(x) becomes a local maximum of 1/f(x), and vice versa. The original graph has a local minimum around (2, -0.67). For y = 1/f(x), this will become a local maximum at approximately (2, 1/(-0.67)) ≈ (2, -1.49).\n4.  **Behavior near asymptotes:**\n    *   As f(x) approaches 0 from above (f(x) → 0⁺), 1/f(x) approaches +∞ (e.g., as x → 1⁻ or x → 3⁺).\n    *   As f(x) approaches 0 from below (f(x) → 0⁻), 1/f(x) approaches -∞ (e.g., as x → 1⁺ or x → 3⁻).\n5.  **Behavior as |f(x)| increases:** As the magnitude of f(x) increases, the magnitude of 1/f(x) decreases, approaching 0. For example, for large positive f(x) (e.g., at x = -4, f(x) = 4), 1/f(x) will be small positive (1/4). As x approaches -∞, f(x) seems to increase, so 1/f(x) would approach 0 from above.\n6.  **Invariant points:** Points where f(x) = 1 or f(x) = -1 are invariant for the transformation.\n\nThe generated plot below illustrates these transformations.",

  "Detailed_Explanation": "Let's break down how to approach sketching these transformed graphs, a common task in the HSC Mathematics Extension 1 and 2 courses.\n\n**General Strategy for Graph Transformations:**\nWhen transforming graphs, always identify key features of the original function $y = f(x)$ first. These include:\n*   x-intercepts (where $f(x) = 0$)\n*   y-intercept (where $x = 0$)\n*   Local maxima and minima (turning points)\n*   Asymptotes (if any)\n*   End behaviour (as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$ or at the domain boundaries)\n*   Points where $f(x) = 1$ or $f(x) = -1$ (important for reciprocal graphs).\n\n**Part (i): Sketching $y = f(|x|)$**\nThis transformation means that the input to the function, $x$, is always taken as its absolute value, $|x|$.\n*   If $x \\ge 0$, then $|x| = x$, so $f(|x|) = f(x)$. This means the part of the graph of $f(x)$ for $x \\ge 0$ remains exactly the same.\n*   If $x < 0$, then $|x| = -x$, so $f(|x|) = f(-x)$. This means the value of $y$ at a negative $x$-coordinate (e.g., $x=-2$) will be the same as the value of $y$ at its positive counterpart (e.g., $x=2$).\n\n**Step-by-step construction for $y = f(|x|)$:**\n1.  **Keep the right half:** Draw the portion of the graph of $y = f(x)$ for all $x \\ge 0$. This includes the y-axis itself and everything to its right.\n2.  **Reflect the right half:** Erase the portion of the original graph for $x < 0$. Then, reflect the retained part (from Step 1) across the y-axis to create the graph for $x < 0$.\n\n**Applying to the given graph:**\n*   **Original graph features for $x \\ge 0$:**\n    *   y-intercept at $(0, 2)$.\n    *   x-intercepts at $(1, 0)$ and $(3, 0)$.\n    *   A local minimum occurs between $x=1$ and $x=3$ (visually around $x=2$, with $y \\approx -0.67$).\n    *   The graph increases after $x=3$.\n*   **Transformed graph $y = f(|x|)$:**\n    *   The segment from $x=0$ to $x=4$ remains unchanged.\n    *   Reflect this segment across the y-axis:\n        *   The y-intercept $(0, 2)$ stays the same.\n        *   The x-intercepts $(1, 0)$ and $(3, 0)$ are reflected to $(-1, 0)$ and $(-3, 0)$ respectively.\n        *   The local minimum at $(2, -0.67)$ is reflected to a new local minimum at $(-2, -0.67)$.\n    *   The final graph will be symmetric about the y-axis.\n\n**Part (ii): Sketching $y = \\frac{1}{f(x)}$**\nThis transformation involves taking the reciprocal of the y-values of the original function. It's crucial to understand how $y$-values change when reciprocated.\n\n**Step-by-step construction for $y = \\frac{1}{f(x)}$:**\n1.  **Vertical Asymptotes:** Identify all $x$-intercepts of $f(x)$ (where $f(x) = 0$). At these $x$-values, $y = \\frac{1}{f(x)}$ will be undefined and will have vertical asymptotes. Draw these as dashed vertical lines.\n2.  **Invariant Points:** Locate points where $f(x) = 1$ or $f(x) = -1$. At these points, $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ will also be $1$ or $-1$, respectively. These points lie on the lines $y=1$ and $y=-1$ for both graphs.\n3.  **y-intercept:** If $f(x)$ has a y-intercept $(0, k)$, then $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ will have a y-intercept $(0, \\frac{1}{k})$.\n4.  **Local Extrema:** A local maximum of $f(x)$ becomes a local minimum of $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ (and vice versa). The y-coordinate of the new extremum will be the reciprocal of the original, and its sign will be preserved.\n5.  **Behavior around asymptotes:**\n    *   If $f(x)$ approaches $0$ from positive values ($f(x) \\to 0^+$), then $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ approaches $+\\infty$.\n    *   If $f(x)$ approaches $0$ from negative values ($f(x) \\to 0^-$), then $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ approaches $-\\infty$.\n6.  **Behavior for large/small $|f(x)|$:**\n    *   If $f(x)$ gets very large (positive or negative, i.e., $|f(x)| \\to \\infty$), then $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ approaches $0$ (the x-axis).\n    *   If $f(x)$ gets very close to $0$ (but not exactly $0$), then $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ gets very large (positive or negative).\n7.  **Rate of change:** If $f(x)$ is increasing and positive, $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ is decreasing and positive. If $f(x)$ is increasing and negative, $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ is also increasing and negative. (The same applies for decreasing functions).\n\n**Applying to the given graph:**\n*   **Original graph features:**\n    *   x-intercepts at $x=1$ and $x=3$.\n    *   y-intercept at $(0, 2)$.\n    *   Local minimum around $(2, -0.67)$.\n*   **Transformed graph $y = \\frac{1}{f(x)}$:**\n    *   **Vertical Asymptotes:** Draw dashed vertical lines at $x=1$ and $x=3$.\n    *   **y-intercept:** The point $(0, 2)$ on $f(x)$ becomes $(0, \\frac{1}{2})$ on $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$.\n    *   **Local Extrema:** The local minimum at $(2, -0.67)$ on $f(x)$ transforms into a local maximum at $(2, \\frac{1}{-0.67}) \\approx (2, -1.49)$ on $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$.\n    *   **Behavior segments:**\n        *   **For $x \\in [-4, 0)$:** $f(x)$ is positive and decreases from $4$ to $2$. So $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ will be positive and increase from $\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n        *   **For $x \\in (0, 1)$:** $f(x)$ is positive and decreases from $2$ to $0$. So $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ will be positive and increase rapidly from $\\frac{1}{2}$ towards $+\\infty$ as $x \\to 1^-$.\n        *   **For $x \\in (1, 2)$:** $f(x)$ is negative and decreases from $0$ to $-0.67$. So $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ will be negative and increase rapidly from $-\\infty$ towards $-1.49$ as $x \\to 2^-$.\n        *   **For $x \\in (2, 3)$:** $f(x)$ is negative and increases from $-0.67$ to $0$. So $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ will be negative and decrease rapidly from $-1.49$ towards $-\\infty$ as $x \\to 3^-$.\n        *   **For $x \\in (3, 4]$:** $f(x)$ is positive and increases from $0$ to $1.5$. So $\\frac{1}{f(x)}$ will be positive and decrease rapidly from $+\\infty$ towards $\\frac{1}{1.5} \\approx 0.67$ as $x \\to 4$.\n\nBy following these rules and connecting the points with appropriate curves, you can accurately sketch the transformed graphs.",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I'd emphasise the following for these types of questions:\n\n1.  **Marking Scheme Focus:** For 'sketching' questions, examiners are looking for key features. These include:\n    *   Correct shape and curvature (concave/convex).\n    *   Correct x- and y-intercepts (label them clearly!).\n    *   Correct position and nature of turning points (max/min).\n    *   Correct asymptotes (dashed lines, labelled).\n    *   Correct domain and range (implied by the sketch, matching the original graph's boundaries).\n    *   Overall smoothness of the curve (unless specified otherwise).\n\n2.  **Precision vs. Perfection:** A sketch does not require plotting exact coordinates for every point, but the critical points (intercepts, turning points, points of inflection, asymptotes) must be accurately placed and labelled. The general shape should be maintained.\n\n3.  **Use of Rulers and Pencils:** Always use a ruler for axes and asymptotes, and a sharp pencil for curves. This allows for corrections and neatness, which helps in conveying your understanding.\n\n4.  **Label Everything:** Label the axes ($x$ and $y$), the origin ($O$), any intercepts, asymptotes (e.g., $x=1, x=3$), and clearly label which sketch is which graph (e.g., $y=f(|x|)$). Lack of labels can cost marks.\n\n5.  **Understanding the 'Why':** Don't just memorise rules. Understand *why* $f(|x|)$ is symmetric about the y-axis (because $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$ are the same for positive $x$) or *why* $1/f(x)$ has vertical asymptotes where $f(x)=0$ (because division by zero is undefined). This deeper understanding helps when encountering more complex transformations.\n\n6.  **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Graph transformations are a core skill in HSC Mathematics. Regularly practising different types of transformations will build confidence and speed. Pay attention to how the transformations affect different parts of the graph, especially near asymptotes and intercepts."
