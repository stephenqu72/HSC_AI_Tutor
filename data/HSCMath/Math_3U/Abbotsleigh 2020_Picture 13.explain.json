  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question requires the application of the t-formulae (also known as the tangent half-angle formulae) to solve a trigonometric equation within a specified domain. \n\n**Step 1: Identify the t-formulae substitutions.**\nThe t-formulae are given by:\nsin(x) = 2t / (1 + t²)\ncos(x) = (1 - t²) / (1 + t²)\nwhere t = tan(x/2).\n\nIn our equation, the angle is 4θ. So, we let x = 4θ, which means t = tan(4θ/2) = tan(2θ).\nSubstitute these into the given equation: sin(4θ) + √3 cos(4θ) = 0.\n\n[2t / (1 + t²)] + √3 * [(1 - t²) / (1 + t²)] = 0\n\n**Step 2: Simplify and solve for t.**\nTo eliminate the denominator (1 + t²), multiply the entire equation by (1 + t²). Note that (1 + t²) is always positive for real values of t, so we don't introduce extraneous solutions or division by zero issues.\n\n2t + √3(1 - t²) = 0\n2t + √3 - √3t² = 0\nRearrange into a standard quadratic form (at² + bt + c = 0):\n√3t² - 2t - √3 = 0\n\nNow, use the quadratic formula: t = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)\nHere, a = √3, b = -2, c = -√3.\n\nt = [2 ± √((-2)² - 4 * √3 * (-√3))] / (2 * √3)\nt = [2 ± √(4 + 12)] / (2√3)\nt = [2 ± √16] / (2√3)\nt = [2 ± 4] / (2√3)\n\nThis gives two possible values for t:\nt₁ = (2 + 4) / (2√3) = 6 / (2√3) = 3/√3 = √3\nt₂ = (2 - 4) / (2√3) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3\n\n**Step 3: Convert t back to the angle (2θ) and find general solutions.**\nRecall that t = tan(2θ).\n\nCase 1: tan(2θ) = √3\nThe principal value for tan⁻¹(√3) is π/3. The general solution for tan(x) = k is x = nπ + tan⁻¹(k), where n is an integer.\nSo, 2θ = nπ + π/3\n\nCase 2: tan(2θ) = -1/√3\nThe principal value for tan⁻¹(-1/√3) is -π/6 (or 5π/6). The general solution is:\n2θ = nπ - π/6 (or 2θ = nπ + 5π/6)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the valid range for 2θ.**\nThe given domain for θ is 0 ≤ θ ≤ π.\nMultiplying by 2, the domain for 2θ is 0 ≤ 2θ ≤ 2π.\n\n**Step 5: Find specific solutions for 2θ within the range [0, 2π].**\n\nFor 2θ = nπ + π/3:\n- If n = 0, 2θ = π/3\n- If n = 1, 2θ = π + π/3 = 4π/3\n- (If n = 2, 2θ = 2π + π/3, which is > 2π, so stop.)\n\nFor 2θ = nπ - π/6:\n- If n = 1, 2θ = π - π/6 = 5π/6 (n=0 gives -π/6, which is outside [0, 2π]; adding π brings it into range)\n- If n = 2, 2θ = 2π - π/6 = 11π/6\n- (If n = 3, 2θ = 3π - π/6, which is > 2π, so stop.)\n\nSo, the values for 2θ are: π/3, 5π/6, 4π/3, 11π/6.\n\n**Step 6: Solve for θ.**\nDivide each value of 2θ by 2:\nθ₁ = (π/3) / 2 = π/6\nθ₂ = (5π/6) / 2 = 5π/12\nθ₃ = (4π/3) / 2 = 2π/3\nθ₄ = (11π/6) / 2 = 11π/12\n\nAll these solutions are within the specified domain 0 ≤ θ ≤ π.\n\n**Step 7: Check for excluded values (critical for t-formulae).**\nThe t-formulae substitution assumes that the angle x (here, 4θ) is not an odd multiple of π, i.e., 4θ ≠ (2k+1)π. If 4θ were an odd multiple of π, then cos(4θ) would be -1, and t = tan(2θ) would be undefined. This corresponds to the point (-1, 0) on the unit circle for (cos(4θ), sin(4θ)).\n\nLet's test if 4θ = π (or 3π, etc.) is a solution to the original equation:\nsin(π) + √3 cos(π) = 0 + √3(-1) = -√3 ≠ 0.\nSo, values of θ for which 4θ = (2k+1)π are not solutions to this specific equation. Therefore, no solutions are missed by using the t-formulae.",
  "Others": "As an HSC Mathematics teacher, I often see students make a few common mistakes with questions like this:\n1.  **Ignoring the 't-formulae' instruction:** Even if you can solve it by dividing by cos(4θ) or using R-formula, the question specifically asks for t-formulae. Not using them will result in loss of marks.\n2.  **Incorrect angle for 't':** Remembering t = tan(x/2) is vital. Many students might mistakenly use t = tan(4θ) or t = tan(θ).\n3.  **Algebraic errors with the quadratic:** Manipulating the quadratic equation in 't' can be tricky, especially with surds. Double-check your calculations, especially the discriminant.\n4.  **Incorrect range for the transformed angle:** The domain given is for θ. You must convert it to the domain for 2θ (i.e., [0, π] becomes [0, 2π]) to find all possible solutions for 2θ.\n5.  **Missing solutions or including extraneous ones:** Be systematic when finding solutions for 2θ from the general solution formula by testing different integer values for 'n'. Make sure to only include solutions within the [0, 2π] range for 2θ before converting to θ.\n6.  **Forgetting to check the edge case:** While not an issue in this particular problem, always consider if the value `x = (2k+1)π` (where t is undefined) is a solution to the original equation. If it is, t-formulae won't find it, and you must check it separately. For `sin(x) + Bcos(x) = C`, if `cos(x) = -1` (i.e., `x = (2k+1)π`), the equation becomes `0 - B = C`, so `-B = C`. If this holds, then `x = (2k+1)π` is a solution. In our case, `B=√3`, `C=0`, so `-√3 ≠ 0`, hence no such solutions are missed.\n\nThis question is a good test of algebraic manipulation, trigonometric identities, and understanding of domain restrictions, all core concepts in HSC 4-Unit Mathematics."
