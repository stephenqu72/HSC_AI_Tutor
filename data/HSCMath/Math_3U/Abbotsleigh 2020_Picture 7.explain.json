  "Detailed_Explanation": "To determine which differential equation matches the given direction field, we need to analyze the properties of the direction field and compare them with the expressions for `dy/dx` in each option.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Features of the Direction Field:**\n    *   **Horizontal Tangents (where dy/dx = 0):** Observe where the slope segments are horizontal. In the given field, horizontal segments appear to lie along a line that passes through points like (2,1), (4,2), (-2,-1), etc. This suggests the line `y = x/2` or `x = 2y`. \n    *   **Vertical Tangents (where dy/dx is undefined):** Observe where the slope segments are vertical. Vertical segments appear to lie along a line that passes through points like (1,-2), (-1,2), (2,-4), etc. This suggests the line `y = -2x` or `2x + y = 0`.\n    *   **Slope at Specific Points:** Pick a few distinct points and estimate the slope from the diagram. For example:\n        *   At (1,0), the slope is clearly negative.\n        *   At (0,1), the slope is clearly positive.\n        *   At (0,0), the slope appears to be vertical (undefined).\n\n2.  **Test Each Option Against the Identified Features:**\n\n    *   **Option A: `dy/dx = (y-2x)/(2y+x)`**\n        *   At (1,0): `dy/dx = (0-2*1)/(2*0+1) = -2/1 = -2`. (Matches negative slope at (1,0)).\n        *   At (0,1): `dy/dx = (1-2*0)/(2*1+0) = 1/2`. The field shows a positive slope, but not necessarily 1/2. More importantly, it does *not* show a vertical tangent where the denominator is zero (2y+x=0) for y=-2x. Let's find vertical tangents: `2y+x=0` means `y = -x/2`. This doesn't match the observed `y = -2x` for vertical tangents.\n        *   Horizontal tangents (`y-2x=0` or `y=2x`) also don't match the observed `y=x/2`.\n        *   So, Option A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option B: `dy/dx = (y-2x)/(2y-x)`**\n        *   At (1,0): `dy/dx = (0-2*1)/(2*0-1) = -2/-1 = 2`. The field shows a negative slope at (1,0). So, Option B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C: `dy/dx = (2y-x)/(y+2x)`**\n        *   **Horizontal Tangents (dy/dx = 0):** Occur when `2y - x = 0`, which means `y = x/2`. Let's check points on this line:\n            *   At (2,1): `dy/dx = (2*1 - 2)/(1 + 2*2) = 0/5 = 0`. This matches the horizontal tangent at (2,1) in the field.\n            *   At (4,2): `dy/dx = (2*2 - 4)/(2 + 2*4) = 0/10 = 0`. Matches.\n            *   At (-2,-1): `dy/dx = (2*(-1) - (-2))/(-1 + 2*(-2)) = 0/-5 = 0`. Matches.\n            This perfectly matches the line of horizontal tangents in the diagram.\n        *   **Vertical Tangents (dy/dx undefined):** Occur when `y + 2x = 0`, which means `y = -2x`. Let's check points on this line:\n            *   At (1,-2): `dy/dx = (2*(-2) - 1)/(-2 + 2*1) = -5/0`. Undefined (vertical). This matches the vertical tangent at (1,-2) in the field.\n            *   At (-1,2): `dy/dx = (2*2 - (-1))/(2 + 2*(-1)) = 5/0`. Undefined (vertical). Matches.\n            This perfectly matches the line of vertical tangents in the diagram.\n        *   **At (0,0):** Both numerator `(2*0-0)` and denominator `(0+2*0)` are zero, resulting in an indeterminate form (0/0). Visually, the field shows a vertical segment at the origin, which is consistent with it being the intersection of the horizontal and vertical tangent lines.\n        *   **Other points:** \n            *   At (1,0): `dy/dx = (2*0 - 1)/(0 + 2*1) = -1/2`. Matches the negative slope in the field.\n            *   At (0,1): `dy/dx = (2*1 - 0)/(1 + 2*0) = 2/1 = 2`. Matches the positive slope in the field.\n        All observations strongly support Option C.\n\n    *   **Option D: `dy/dx = (x-2y)/(2y+x)`**\n        *   At (1,0): `dy/dx = (1-2*0)/(2*0+1) = 1/1 = 1`. The field shows a negative slope at (1,0). So, Option D is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Option C consistently matches all key features of the given direction field.\n\nThis method of checking lines of zero slope, infinite slope, and slopes at specific points is a reliable strategy for solving such problems in the HSC context."
