  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question requires you to differentiate a composite function involving the inverse sine function. This is a common application of the Chain Rule in HSC Mathematics Extension 1.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n1.  **Derivative of the inverse sine function:** You must know the standard derivative of $y = \\arcsin(u)$.\n    $$ \\frac{d}{du} (\\arcsin(u)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - u^2}} $$\n2.  **Chain Rule:** If $y = f(g(x))$, then its derivative is $y' = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. This means you differentiate the 'outer' function with respect to the 'inner' function, and then multiply by the derivative of the 'inner' function with respect to $x$.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the outer and inner functions.**\nGiven the function $f(x) = \\arcsin(x^5)$.\nLet $u = x^5$ (this is our 'inner' function).\nThen $f(x)$ can be written as $f(x) = \\arcsin(u)$ (this is our 'outer' function).\n\n**Step 2: Differentiate the outer function with respect to $u$.**\nUsing the standard derivative of $\\arcsin(u)$:\n$$ \\frac{df}{du} = \\frac{d}{du} (\\arcsin(u)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - u^2}} $$\n\n**Step 3: Differentiate the inner function with respect to $x$.**\nOur inner function is $u = x^5$.\nUsing the power rule for differentiation ($\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$):\n$$ \\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} (x^5) = 5x^{5-1} = 5x^4 $$\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Chain Rule.**\nThe Chain Rule states that $f'(x) = \\frac{df}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx}$.\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 2 and Step 3 into the Chain Rule formula:\n$$ f'(x) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - u^2}} \\right) \\cdot (5x^4) $$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute $u$ back in terms of $x$ and simplify.**\nRecall that $u = x^5$. Substitute this back into the expression for $f'(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (x^5)^2}} \\cdot 5x^4 $$\nSimplify the term $(x^5)^2$: $(x^5)^2 = x^{5 \\cdot 2} = x^{10}$.\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - x^{10}}} \\cdot 5x^4 $$\nFinally, write the expression as a single fraction:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{5x^4}{\\sqrt{1 - x^{10}}} $$\nThis is the final derivative of the given function.",
  "Others": "For HSC students tackling differentiation questions, especially those involving composite functions:\n\n1.  **Memorise Standard Derivatives:** Ensure you have the derivatives of all standard functions (polynomials, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and their inverses) committed to memory. These are often provided on a reference sheet, but knowing them speeds up the process and reduces errors.\n2.  **Recognise the Chain Rule:** The most common mistake is forgetting to apply the Chain Rule when the argument of a function is not simply $x$. If you have $f(g(x))$ instead of $f(x)$, the Chain Rule is essential.\n3.  **Step-by-Step Approach:** Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps (identify inner/outer, differentiate each, combine). This makes complex problems less daunting and reduces calculation errors.\n4.  **Practice:** Differentiation skills are built through consistent practice. Work through a variety of examples involving different types of functions and combinations of rules (chain, product, quotient).\n5.  **Check Your Work:** After finding the derivative, quickly mentally (or on scratch paper) differentiate your result or a similar simpler function to ensure your method is sound."
