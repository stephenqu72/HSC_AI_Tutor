  "Answer": "(i) The minimum number of classrooms the school needs is 69.\n\n(ii) The minimum number of classrooms (69) is derived assuming a perfectly even distribution of classes across all 40 periods. However, in a real school environment, this even distribution is often not achievable due to practical constraints. For example:\n*   Specific subjects like Science or Art require dedicated, specialised classrooms (labs, studios), which cannot be used by general classes.\n*   Timetabling must account for teacher availability, ensuring teachers are not double-booked. Also, entire year groups might need to attend the same core subject simultaneously, creating higher demand in specific periods.\n*   Some classes might be scheduled as double periods, occupying a classroom for two consecutive slots.\n*   Other logistical factors, such as classroom maintenance or school events, can reduce the number of available rooms in certain periods.\n\nThese factors can lead to an uneven peak demand, meaning that some periods will have more than 69 classes needing rooms concurrently, thereby requiring more than the theoretical minimum number of classrooms.",

  "Detailed_Explanation": "Here's a detailed, step-by-step explanation:\n\n**Part (i): Using the Pigeonhole Principle**\n1.  **Understand the Pigeonhole Principle:** The Pigeonhole Principle states that if `n` items (pigeons) are distributed into `k` containers (pigeonholes), then at least one container must contain `ceil(n/k)` items, where `ceil(x)` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`.\n2.  **Identify Pigeons and Pigeonholes:**\n    *   The 'pigeons' are the individual classes that need to be scheduled. Total classes, `n = 2733`.\n    *   The 'pigeonholes' are the periods available over a fortnight into which these classes are scheduled. Total periods, `k = 40`.\n3.  **Apply the Principle:** We want to find the maximum number of classes that *could* be scheduled simultaneously in any given period, which will dictate the minimum number of classrooms required. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one period must contain `ceil(n/k)` classes.\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Divide the total number of classes by the total number of periods: `2733 / 40 = 68.325`.\n    *   Apply the ceiling function: `ceil(68.325) = 69`.\n5.  **Conclusion for (i):** This means that, no matter how evenly the classes are distributed across the 40 periods, there will always be at least one period where 69 classes are scheduled concurrently. To ensure every class in that busiest period has a separate classroom, the school must have a minimum of 69 classrooms available.",
  "Others": "This question is a classic application of the Pigeonhole Principle, often encountered in HSC Mathematics Extension 1 or Extension 2. Students often find part (ii) more challenging as it requires real-world reasoning beyond a direct calculation. When answering such questions, remember to:\n*   **Clearly define your 'pigeons' and 'pigeonholes'.** This helps demonstrate understanding of the principle.\n*   **Show your calculation for part (i).** Even if it's a simple division, showing the steps is crucial for gaining full marks.\n*   **For part (ii), provide specific examples of why real-world scenarios differ from theoretical ideals.** Generic statements like 'it's not always even' are not sufficient. Mentioning specialist rooms (labs, studios), teacher timetabling, and year-group-specific scheduling constraints shows a deeper understanding of the practical limitations of school timetabling."
