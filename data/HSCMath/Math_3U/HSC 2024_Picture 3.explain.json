  "Detailed_Explanation": "To solve this problem, we need to use the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes and each pigeon must be in a pigeonhole, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this context, the 'pigeons' are the students and the 'pigeonholes' are the schools. We need to find the minimum number of students (pigeons) such that at least one school (pigeonhole) must have at least 20 students.\n\nLet's denote the number of students from each school as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\). According to the pigeonhole principle, if we have \\(n\\) students and 4 schools, the worst-case scenario is that the students are distributed as evenly as possible among the schools. If we have 79 students, the worst-case distribution would be 19 students in each of the first three schools and 20 students in the fourth school. This means that with 79 students, it is possible that no school has more than 19 students. However, if we have 80 students, the worst-case distribution would be 19 students in each of the first three schools and 21 students in the fourth school. This means that at least one school must have at least 20 students.\n\nTherefore, the minimum size of the choir to ensure that at least one school has at least 20 students is 80.",
  "Others": "This problem is a classic application of the pigeonhole principle, a fundamental concept in combinatorics. It is a common type of problem in HSC Mathematics and is often used to test students' understanding of logical reasoning and problem-solving skills."
