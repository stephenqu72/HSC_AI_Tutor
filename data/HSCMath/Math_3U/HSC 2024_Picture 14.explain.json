  "Answer": "The differential equation $\\frac{dy}{dx} = xy$ can be solved by separation of variables. We rewrite it as $\\frac{1}{y}dy = xdx$. Integrating both sides gives $\\ln|y| = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration. Exponentiating both sides, we get $|y| = e^{\\frac{x^2}{2} + C} = e^C e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}$. Since $y > 0$, we can drop the absolute value and write $y = e^C e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}} = Ce^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}$, where $C$ is now a positive constant. Therefore, the solution is $y = e^{f(x)}$, where $f(x) = \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\ln C$.",

  "Detailed_Explanation": "To solve the differential equation $\\frac{dy}{dx} = xy$, we start by separating the variables, which means we rewrite the equation as $\\frac{1}{y}dy = xdx$. This step is justified because we can divide both sides by $y$ and $dx$ respectively, assuming $y \\neq 0$. The next step is to integrate both sides of the equation. The left side integrates to $\\ln|y| + C_1$ and the right side integrates to $\\frac{x^2}{2} + C_2$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration. Since we are given $y > 0$, we can drop the absolute value and combine the constants into a single constant $C = e^{C_1}$. Thus, we have $\\ln y = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C$. Exponentiating both sides gives $y = e^{\\frac{x^2}{2} + C} = Ce^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}$, where $C$ is a positive constant. This is the general solution to the differential equation. The form $y = e^{f(x)}$ is obtained by recognizing that $f(x) = \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\ln C$.",
  "Others": "This problem is a classic example of solving a separable differential equation. It is important to remember that when integrating, the constant of integration can be absorbed into the exponential function, and the solution can be expressed in the form $y = e^{f(x)}$. This form is particularly useful in HSC mathematics as it often simplifies further analysis and interpretation of the solution."
