  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question tests your understanding of sampling distributions for proportions, specifically how the mean of sample proportions and its variability change with more data.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n**1. Identify Key Information:**\n*   Population proportion ($p$) = 64% = 0.64.\n*   Size of each individual sample ($n$) = 50 students.\n*   Initial number of random samples ($K_{initial}$) = 20.\n*   Current mean of these 20 sample proportions ($\\hat{p}_{current}$) = 0.585.\n*   Five *more* random samples are taken, meaning the new total number of samples ($K_{new}$) = $20 + 5 = 25$.\n\n**2. Analyze the change in $\\hat{p}$ (the mean of sample proportions):**\n*   The true population proportion is $p = 0.64$.\n*   The $\\hat{p} = 0.585$ given in the question represents the mean of the 20 sample proportions collected so far. This value is an *estimator* of the true population proportion $p$.\n*   According to the Law of Large Numbers, as the number of samples (and thus the total amount of data) increases, the sample mean (in this case, the mean of the sample proportions) is expected to converge to the true population mean (or proportion, $p$).\n*   Since the current mean of sample proportions ($0.585$) is less than the true population proportion ($0.64$), it is most likely that with five more samples, the updated mean of 25 sample proportions will *increase* and move closer to the true value of $0.64$.\n\n**3. Analyze the change in $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}$ (the standard deviation term):**\n*   The notation $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}$ can sometimes be ambiguous. In HSC statistics, $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ refers to the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a *single* sample proportion. However, the question refers to the 'mean of *these* sample proportions' and then asks about $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}$. In such contexts, $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}$ most commonly refers to the **standard error of the mean of the sample proportions**, which measures the variability of this estimator.\n*   Let $\bar{\\hat{p}}_K$ denote the mean of $K$ sample proportions. The standard deviation of $\bar{\\hat{p}}_K$ (its standard error) is given by the formula:\n    $$\\sigma_{\\bar{\\hat{p}}_K} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}}{\\sqrt{K}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}{\\sqrt{K}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{nK}}$$ \n    where:\n    *   $p$ is the population proportion (0.64)\n    *   $n$ is the size of each individual sample (50)\n    *   $K$ is the number of samples collected (initially 20, then 25)\n*   In this scenario, $p$ and $n$ remain constant. The number of samples, $K$, increases from 20 to 25.\n*   Since $K$ is in the denominator of the square root, an increase in $K$ will cause $\\sigma_{\\bar{\\hat{p}}_K}$ to **decrease**. This means the estimator ($\\hat{p}$, the mean of the sample proportions) becomes more precise and less variable as more samples are included.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n*   The mean of the sample proportions ($\\hat{p}$) is most likely to **increase** towards the true population proportion of 0.64.\n*   The standard deviation of the mean of the sample proportions ($\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}$ as interpreted here) is most likely to **decrease** as the number of samples ($K$) increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B: $\\hat{p}$ increases and $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}}$ decreases.",
  "Others": "This question highlights a critical distinction in HSC Statistics: the difference between the standard deviation of a *single sample proportion* (which depends on $n$) and the standard deviation of the *mean of multiple sample proportions* (which depends on $n$ AND the number of samples, $K$). When asked about the variability of an 'estimate' derived from multiple samples, it's almost always referring to the standard error of that estimate, which will generally decrease as more samples are included, leading to a more precise overall estimate.\n\nStudents often confuse $n$ (individual sample size) with $K$ (number of samples). Make sure to clearly understand that $n$ affects the variability of each $\\hat{p}_i$, while $K$ affects the variability of the *average* of those $\\hat{p}_i$'s."
