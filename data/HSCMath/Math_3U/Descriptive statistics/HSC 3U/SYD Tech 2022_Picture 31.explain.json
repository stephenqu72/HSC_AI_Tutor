  "Detailed_Explanation": "This problem involves concepts of sampling distributions, particularly the sample proportion, and the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, which are key topics in HSC Mathematics Advanced and Extension 1.\n\n### Part (b) (i): Show that the sample mean is $0.05$ and the sample standard deviation is $0.01723$.\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Sample size ($n$) = $160$ televisions.\n    *   Number of defective televisions ($x$) = $8$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Sample Proportion ($\\hat{p}$):**\n    The sample proportion is the proportion of defective items in the sample.\n    $$\\hat{p} = \\frac{\\text{Number of defective televisions}}{\\text{Total number of televisions in sample}} = \\frac{x}{n}$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\hat{p} = \\frac{8}{160} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$$\n\n3.  **Determine the Sample Mean (of the sample proportion):**\n    For a large sample size, the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ is an unbiased estimator of the population proportion $p$. The mean of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is $E(\\hat{p}) = p$. Since we are using the sample to estimate the population proportion, we use $\\hat{p}$ as our best estimate for $p$. Therefore, the sample mean (referring to the mean of the sample proportion distribution) is:\n    $$E(\\hat{p}) = \\hat{p} = 0.05$$\n    This shows that the sample mean is $0.05$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Sample Standard Deviation (of the sample proportion):**\n    The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ is given by the formula:\n    $$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$\n    Since we don't know the true population proportion $p$, we use the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ as an estimate for $p$ in the formula:\n    $$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$$\n    Substituting the values:\n    $$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.05(1-0.05)}{160}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.05 \\times 0.95}{160}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0475}{160}}$$ \n    $$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{0.000296875} \\approx 0.01722997...$$\n    Rounding to five decimal places as suggested by the target value:\n    $$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} \\approx 0.01723$$\n    This shows that the sample standard deviation is $0.01723$.\n\n### Part (b) (ii): Estimate the probability that the number of defective televisions purchased is at least 4 but no more than 6.\n\n1.  **Identify Parameters for the Binomial Distribution:**\n    The Hilton group purchases $N=160$ televisions. Based on Samsung's quality check, the proportion of defective televisions (population proportion) is estimated as $p = 0.05$ (from part i).\n    Let $X$ be the number of defective televisions purchased. $X$ follows a Binomial Distribution $B(N, p)$, i.e., $B(160, 0.05)$.\n\n2.  **Check Conditions for Normal Approximation:**\n    For the normal approximation to the binomial distribution to be valid, we need $Np \\ge 5$ and $N(1-p) \\ge 5$.\n    *   $Np = 160 \\times 0.05 = 8 \\ge 5$ (Condition met)\n    *   $N(1-p) = 160 \\times (1-0.05) = 160 \\times 0.95 = 152 \\ge 5$ (Condition met)\n    Since both conditions are met, we can use the normal approximation.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean ($\\mu$) and Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$) for the Number of Defectives:**\n    For a binomial distribution approximated by a normal distribution:\n    *   Mean: $\\mu = Np = 160 \\times 0.05 = 8$\n    *   Standard Deviation: $\\sigma = \\sqrt{Np(1-p)} = \\sqrt{160 \\times 0.05 \\times (1-0.05)} = \\sqrt{160 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.95} = \\sqrt{8 \\times 0.95} = \\sqrt{7.6}$\n    $$\\sigma \\approx 2.75680975$$\n\n4.  **Apply Continuity Correction:**\n    The question asks for the probability that the number of defective televisions is at least 4 but no more than 6, i.e., $P(4 \\le X \\le 6)$. Since $X$ is a discrete variable and we are approximating it with a continuous normal distribution, we must apply continuity correction:\n    *   'At least 4' (i.e., $X=4, 5, 6, ...$) becomes $X_{cont} \\ge 3.5$.\n    *   'No more than 6' (i.e., $X=..., 4, 5, 6$) becomes $X_{cont} \\le 6.5$.\n    Therefore, $P(4 \\le X \\le 6)$ is approximated by $P(3.5 \\le X_{cont} \\le 6.5)$.\n\n5.  **Convert to Z-scores:**\n    The formula for a z-score is $Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$.\n    *   For $X_{cont} = 3.5$:\n        $$z_1 = \\frac{3.5 - 8}{2.75680975} = \\frac{-4.5}{2.75680975} \\approx -1.6322$$ \n        Rounding to two decimal places for table lookup: $z_1 \\approx -1.63$\n\n    *   For $X_{cont} = 6.5$:\n        $$z_2 = \\frac{6.5 - 8}{2.75680975} = \\frac{-1.5}{2.75680975} \\approx -0.5441$$\n        Rounding to two decimal places for table lookup: $z_2 \\approx -0.54$\n\n6.  **Use the Z-score Table to Find Probabilities:**\n    We need to find $P(-1.63 \\le Z \\le -0.54)$.\n    The z-table provided gives $P(Z \\le z)$ for positive $z$. We use the symmetry property of the standard normal distribution: $P(Z \\le -z) = 1 - P(Z \\le z)$.\n\n    *   For $z_2 = -0.54$:\n        $P(Z \\le -0.54) = 1 - P(Z \\le 0.54)$\n        From the table, for $Z=0.5$ and column $.04$, $P(Z \\le 0.54) = 0.70540$.\n        So, $P(Z \\le -0.54) = 1 - 0.70540 = 0.29460$.\n\n    *   For $z_1 = -1.63$:\n        $P(Z \\le -1.63) = 1 - P(Z \\le 1.63)$\n        From the table, for $Z=1.6$ and column $.03$, $P(Z \\le 1.63) = 0.94845$.\n        So, $P(Z \\le -1.63) = 1 - 0.94845 = 0.05155$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    $P(-1.63 \\le Z \\le -0.54) = P(Z \\le -0.54) - P(Z \\le -1.63)$\n    $$P(-1.63 \\le Z \\le -0.54) = 0.29460 - 0.05155 = 0.24305$$\n    The estimated probability is $0.24305$.\n\n",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I'd highlight a few crucial points for students tackling this type of question:\n\n1.  **Read Carefully:** Distinguish between questions about the 'sample proportion' ($\\hat{p}$) and the 'number of successes' ($X$). Part (i) is about $\\hat{p}$ (its mean and standard deviation), while part (ii) is about $X$ (the number of defective televisions).\n2.  **Formulas:** Be meticulous with the correct formulas. For sample proportion: $E(\\hat{p}) = p$ and $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$. For the number of successes: $\\mu = Np$ and $\\sigma = \\sqrt{Np(1-p)}$. Notice how $p$ is often estimated by $\\hat{p}$ if the true population $p$ is unknown.\n3.  **Normal Approximation Conditions:** Always state and check the conditions for normal approximation ($Np \\ge 5$ and $N(1-p) \\ge 5$). This shows understanding of when the approximation is valid.\n4.  **Continuity Correction is CRITICAL:** This is a common pitfall. Remember to adjust the discrete boundaries by $\\pm 0.5$ when converting from a discrete (binomial) to a continuous (normal) distribution. For example, $P(X=k)$ becomes $P(k-0.5 \\le X_{cont} \\le k+0.5)$, and $P(a \\le X \\le b)$ becomes $P(a-0.5 \\le X_{cont} \\le b+0.5)$.\n5.  **Z-Score Table Usage:** Pay attention to how your specific z-table works. Most tables give $P(Z \\le z)$ for $z \\ge 0$. You'll need to use the symmetry property ($P(Z \\le -z) = 1 - P(Z \\le z)$) for negative z-scores. Be careful with rounding z-scores to two decimal places if the table resolution is two decimal places, as interpolation is generally not expected in the HSC context unless explicitly mentioned or a specific interpolation method is provided.\n6.  **Accuracy and Rounding:** Maintain sufficient precision during intermediate calculations (e.g., for $\\sigma$) to avoid rounding errors, then round the final answer to an appropriate number of decimal places (usually 3 or 4, or as specified by the question's context or similar values in the problem)."
