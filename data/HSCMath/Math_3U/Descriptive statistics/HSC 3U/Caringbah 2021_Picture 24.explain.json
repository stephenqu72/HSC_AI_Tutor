  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question involves using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution for a sample proportion problem. It tests your understanding of calculating the mean and standard deviation for the number of successes in a sample, applying continuity correction, and using the standard normal distribution table.\n\n### (a) (i) Show that the mean is 58.1 and standard deviation is 4.17 for such sample proportions.\n\n**Key Concept:** When dealing with a large sample size ($n$) from a population with a known proportion ($p$) of successes, the number of successes ($X$) in the sample follows a binomial distribution, $X \\sim B(n, p)$. For sufficiently large $n$, this binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = np$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = \\sqrt{np(1-p)}$.\n\n1.  **Identify the given parameters:**\n    *   Population proportion of students participating in athletics, $p = 70\\% = 0.70$.\n    *   Sample size, $n = 83$ students.\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean ($\\mu$) of the number of students:**\n    The mean number of students participating in athletics in a sample of 83 is given by:\n    $$\\mu = np$$\n    $$\\mu = 83 \\times 0.70$$\n    $$\\mu = 58.1$$\n    This matches the value given in the question.\n\n3.  **Calculate the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of the number of students:**\n    The standard deviation of the number of students participating in athletics in a sample of 83 is given by:\n    $$\\sigma = \\sqrt{np(1-p)}$$\n    $$\\sigma = \\sqrt{83 \\times 0.70 \\times (1-0.70)}$$\n    $$\\sigma = \\sqrt{83 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.30}$$\n    $$\\sigma = \\sqrt{17.43}$$\n    $$\\sigma \\approx 4.17492589$$\n\n4.  **Round to the specified precision:**\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the standard deviation is $4.17$.\n    This matches the value given in the question.\n\n### (a) (ii) Use the table below of values of $P(Z \\le z)$, where $Z$ has a Standard Normal distribution, to estimate the probability that a sample of 83 students will contain at most 55 who participate in athletics.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n*   **Normal Approximation to Binomial:** When $n$ is large (typically $np \\ge 5$ and $n(1-p) \\ge 5$), a binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution.\n*   **Continuity Correction:** Since the binomial distribution is discrete and the normal distribution is continuous, a continuity correction must be applied. For $P(X \\le k)$, we approximate it with $P(X_c \\le k+0.5)$. For $P(X < k)$, it's $P(X_c \\le k-0.5)$.\n*   **Z-score Formula:** To use the standard normal table, we convert a value $X_c$ from a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ into a Z-score: $Z = \\frac{X_c - \\mu}{\\sigma}$.\n*   **Symmetry of Standard Normal Distribution:** The standard normal distribution is symmetric about its mean (0). This implies $P(Z \\le -z) = P(Z \\ge z) = 1 - P(Z \\le z)$.\n\n1.  **Check conditions for Normal Approximation:**\n    *   $np = 58.1 \\ge 5$\n    *   $n(1-p) = 83 \\times 0.30 = 24.9 \\ge 5$\n    The conditions are met, so normal approximation is appropriate.\n\n2.  **State the problem in terms of the number of students:**\n    We want to find the probability that at most 55 students participate, i.e., $P(X \\le 55)$.\n\n3.  **Apply Continuity Correction:**\n    To approximate $P(X \\le 55)$ using a continuous normal distribution, we extend the range by $0.5$: $P(X_c \\le 55.5)$.\n\n4.  **Identify the mean ($\\mu$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma$) from part (a)(i):**\n    *   $\\mu = 58.1$\n    *   $\\sigma \\approx 4.17492589$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Z-score:**\n    Convert $X_c = 55.5$ to a Z-score:\n    $$Z = \\frac{55.5 - 58.1}{4.17492589}$$\n    $$Z = \\frac{-2.6}{4.17492589}$$\n    $$Z \\approx -0.62279$$\n    Rounding to two decimal places for the Z-table, $Z \\approx -0.62$.\n\n6.  **Use the Standard Normal Distribution Table:**\n    The table provided gives $P(Z \\le z)$ for positive values of $z$. We need $P(Z \\le -0.62)$.\n    Using the symmetry property:\n    $$P(Z \\le -0.62) = 1 - P(Z \\le 0.62)$$\n    Now, look up $P(Z \\le 0.62)$ in the table:\n    *   Find $0.6$ in the left column.\n    *   Find $0.02$ in the top row.\n    *   The corresponding entry is $0.7324$.\n    So, $P(Z \\le 0.62) = 0.7324$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final probability:**\n    $$P(Z \\le -0.62) = 1 - 0.7324$$\n    $$P(Z \\le -0.62) = 0.2676$$\n\nTherefore, the estimated probability is $0.2676$.",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I often see students make a few common mistakes with these types of problems:\n\n1.  **Confusing Proportion vs. Number:** The phrasing in (a)(i) is tricky. \"Mean and standard deviation for such sample proportions\" might mislead students to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the *sample proportion* $\\hat{p}$ (which would be $p = 0.7$ and $\\sqrt{p(1-p)/n} \\approx 0.0505$). However, the given values of $58.1$ and $4.17$ clearly indicate they refer to the *number* of students. Always double-check what the question is truly asking for, and verify with the expected values if provided.\n\n2.  **Forgetting Continuity Correction:** This is a very common error. When approximating a discrete distribution (like binomial counts) with a continuous one (normal distribution), a continuity correction of $0.5$ is crucial. Remember: \n    *   $P(X \\le k)$ becomes $P(X_c \\le k+0.5)$\n    *   $P(X < k)$ becomes $P(X_c \\le k-0.5)$ (which is equivalent to $P(X \\le k-1)$)\n    *   $P(X \\ge k)$ becomes $P(X_c \\ge k-0.5)$\n    *   $P(X > k)$ becomes $P(X_c \\ge k+0.5)$ (which is equivalent to $P(X \\ge k+1)$)\n\n3.  **Incorrectly Using the Z-Table for Negative Z-scores:** Many tables, like the one provided, only list probabilities for positive Z-scores. Students must remember the symmetry property: $P(Z \\le -z) = 1 - P(Z \\le z)$. Visualising this with a standard normal curve can be very helpful.\n\n4.  **Rounding Errors:** Be careful with rounding at intermediate steps. While rounding the Z-score to two decimal places for table lookup is standard, avoid rounding the standard deviation too early if it leads to significant inaccuracies in the Z-score. In this case, $\\sqrt{17.43}$ was used in the Z-score calculation, and only the final Z-score was rounded for table lookup.\n\n5.  **Conditions for Normal Approximation:** While not explicitly asked here, it's good practice to always check if $np \\ge 5$ and $n(1-p) \\ge 5$ (some texts use 10 instead of 5) to justify using the normal approximation. If these conditions are not met, the approximation may not be accurate.\n\nMastering these concepts is fundamental for success in HSC Statistics, particularly in the areas of Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals, which often build upon the understanding of sample distributions."
