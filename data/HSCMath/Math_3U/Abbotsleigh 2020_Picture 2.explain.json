  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question asks for the integral that represents the volume of a solid of revolution formed by rotating the curve $y = \\sqrt{16-(x+1)^2}$ about the x-axis. This is a common topic in HSC Mathematics Extension 1 and 2.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve it:\n\n1.  **Recall the Formula for Volume of Revolution:**\n    For a curve $y=f(x)$ rotated about the x-axis between $x=a$ and $x=b$, the volume $V$ of the solid of revolution is given by the disk method (or washer method if there's a hole):\n    $V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} y^2 dx$\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Function and Calculate $y^2$:**\n    The given curve is $y = \\sqrt{16-(x+1)^2}$.\n    To use the formula, we need $y^2$: \n    $y^2 = (\\sqrt{16-(x+1)^2})^2 = 16-(x+1)^2$\n\n3.  **Determine the Limits of Integration (a and b):**\n    The curve is $y = \\sqrt{16-(x+1)^2}$. This represents the upper semi-circle of the circle $(x+1)^2 + y^2 = 16$. The solid is formed by rotating this portion of the curve. The limits of integration are the x-intercepts, where the curve meets the x-axis (i.e., where $y=0$).\n    Set $y=0$: \n    $0 = \\sqrt{16-(x+1)^2}$\n    Squaring both sides:\n    $0 = 16-(x+1)^2$\n    $(x+1)^2 = 16$\n    Take the square root of both sides:\n    $x+1 = \\pm 4$\n    This gives two possible values for $x$:\n    a) $x+1 = 4 \\implies x = 3$\n    b) $x+1 = -4 \\implies x = -5$\n    So, the limits of integration are from $x = -5$ to $x = 3$.\n\n4.  **Construct the Integral:**\n    Now substitute $y^2 = 16-(x+1)^2$ and the limits $a=-5$, $b=3$ into the volume formula:\n    $V = \\pi \\int_{-5}^{3} (16-(x+1)^2) dx$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   **A.** $\\pi \\int_{-4}^{4} (16-(x+1)^2) dx$ - Incorrect limits.\n    *   **B.** $\\pi \\int_{-5}^{3} (\\sqrt{16-(x+1)^2})^2 dx$ - Correct limits, and the integrand is correctly $y^2$ (before simplification).\n    *   **C.** $\\pi \\int_{-5}^{3} (16-(x+1)^2)^2 dx$ - Incorrect integrand; this is $(y^2)^2 = y^4$, not $y^2$.\n    *   **D.** $\\pi \\int_{-5}^{3} (16-(x+1)^2) dx$ - Correct limits, and the integrand is the simplified form of $y^2$.\n\n6.  **Choose the Best Answer:**\n    Both option B and option D are mathematically equivalent and represent the correct volume. However, in mathematics, it is standard practice to simplify algebraic expressions where possible. The integrand $16-(x+1)^2$ (as in option D) is the simplified form of $(\\sqrt{16-(x+1)^2})^2$ (as in option B). When setting up an integral for calculation, you would always use the simplified form. Therefore, option D is considered the most appropriate and conventional representation of the integral.",
  "Others": "For HSC students, this question is a great reminder of several key concepts:\n1.  **Formula Recognition:** Knowing the correct formula for the volume of revolution about the x-axis ($V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} y^2 dx$) is fundamental.\n2.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be careful when squaring expressions, especially those involving square roots. $(\\sqrt{A})^2 = A$, not $A^2$.\n3.  **Finding Limits of Integration:** Always determine the correct bounds for the integral. For solids of revolution generated by a curve and the x-axis, these are typically the x-intercepts.\n4.  **Recognising Standard Forms:** The curve $y = \\sqrt{16-(x+1)^2}$ is a semi-circle, which is a common shape. Recognising this can help verify the limits and the final answer (the volume of a sphere is $4/3 \\pi r^3$). If you were to evaluate this integral, you would get $\\frac{256\\pi}{3}$, which is the volume of a sphere with radius 4.\n\nPay close attention to subtle differences in options, like the extra square in option C. While both B and D are technically correct, D represents the simplified integrand, which is typically expected in the final integral setup for evaluation."
