  "Detailed_Explanation": "To determine the domain and range of the function $y = 2\\cos^{-1}(2x) + 2\\sin^{-1}(2x)$, we follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Domain**\n*   The inverse trigonometric functions $\\cos^{-1}(u)$ and $\\sin^{-1}(u)$ are defined only for $u$ within the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n*   In our function, the argument for both $\\cos^{-1}$ and $\\sin^{-1}$ is $2x$.\n*   Therefore, for the function to be defined, we must satisfy the condition: $-1 \\le 2x \\le 1$.\n*   To solve for $x$, divide all parts of the inequality by 2:\n    $\\frac{-1}{2} \\le \\frac{2x}{2} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$\n    $-0.5 \\le x \\le 0.5$\n*   Thus, the domain of the function is $[-0.5, 0.5]$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Range**\n*   This step requires recalling a key identity from inverse trigonometric functions: For any $u \\in [-1, 1]$, the identity $\\sin^{-1}(u) + \\cos^{-1}(u) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ holds true.\n*   In our function, the argument $u = 2x$. Since our domain is $[-0.5, 0.5]$, this guarantees that $2x$ will always be in the interval $[-1, 1]$, so the identity is applicable.\n*   The given function is $y = 2\\cos^{-1}(2x) + 2\\sin^{-1}(2x)$.\n*   We can factor out the common constant 2:\n    $y = 2(\\cos^{-1}(2x) + \\sin^{-1}(2x))$\n*   Now, apply the identity $\\cos^{-1}(2x) + \\sin^{-1}(2x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n    $y = 2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    $y = \\pi$\n*   Since the value of $y$ is always $\\pi$ for any $x$ within the domain $[-0.5, 0.5]$, the range of the function is a single value, $\\{\\pi\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the Answer**\n*   Based on our calculations, the domain is $[-0.5, 0.5]$ and the range is $\\{\\pi\\}$.\n*   Comparing this with the given options, option A matches our findings.",
  "Others": "This question is a classic example of how HSC Extension 1 Mathematics tests your understanding of fundamental inverse trigonometric identities. Students often make the mistake of trying to find the range by considering the ranges of $2\\cos^{-1}(2x)$ and $2\\sin^{-1}(2x)$ independently and summing them, which is a much more complex and usually incorrect approach for a combined function like this. Always look for opportunities to simplify using identities! Recognising $\\cos^{-1}(u) + \\sin^{-1}(u) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is crucial for efficiency and accuracy. This identity simplifies the problem from a complex analysis of two functions to a trivial calculation."
