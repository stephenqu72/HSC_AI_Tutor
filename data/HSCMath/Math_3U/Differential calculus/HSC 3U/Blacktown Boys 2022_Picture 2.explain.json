  "Detailed_Explanation": "To determine the differential equation that corresponds to a given slope field, we need to analyse the behaviour of the slopes (gradients) at various points $(x,y)$ on the graph and compare them with the expressions for $dy/dx$ given in the options.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Observe dependence on $x$ or $y$:**\n    *   Look at a vertical line (constant $x$). If all slope segments along this line are parallel, it means $dy/dx$ depends only on $x$, i.e., $dy/dx = f(x)$.\n    *   Look at a horizontal line (constant $y$). If all slope segments along this line are parallel, it means $dy/dx$ depends only on $y$, i.e., $dy/dx = f(y)$.\n    *   If slopes vary along both vertical and horizontal lines, then $dy/dx = f(x,y)$.\n\n    In the given slope field, observe any vertical line (e.g., $x=1$ or $x=2$). All the short line segments on a specific vertical line are parallel. This indicates that the slope $dy/dx$ depends *only* on $x$, not on $y$. This immediately allows us to eliminate options B and D, as they are functions of $y$.\n    *   A. $dy/dx = -x/2$ (depends on $x$ only) - *Possible*\n    *   B. $dy/dx = -y/2$ (depends on $y$ only) - *Eliminated*\n    *   C. $dy/dx = x/2$ (depends on $x$ only) - *Possible*\n    *   D. $dy/dx = y/2$ (depends on $y$ only) - *Eliminated*\n\n2.  **Examine the slopes along the y-axis ($x=0$):**\n    *   Along the y-axis, the slope segments are horizontal. This means that at any point $(0, y)$, the slope $dy/dx$ must be $0$.\n    *   Let's check the remaining options:\n        *   A. $dy/dx = -x/2$. At $x=0$, $dy/dx = -0/2 = 0$. This matches the observation.\n        *   C. $dy/dx = x/2$. At $x=0$, $dy/dx = 0/2 = 0$. This also matches the observation.\n\n3.  **Examine the slopes in different regions:**\n    *   **For $x>0$ (right-hand side of the y-axis):** The slope segments are generally pointing downwards, indicating negative slopes ($dy/dx < 0$).\n        *   Let's check option A: $dy/dx = -x/2$. If $x>0$, then $-x/2$ will be negative. This matches the observation.\n        *   Let's check option C: $dy/dx = x/2$. If $x>0$, then $x/2$ will be positive. This contradicts the observation. So, option C is incorrect.\n    *   **For $x<0$ (left-hand side of the y-axis):** The slope segments are generally pointing upwards, indicating positive slopes ($dy/dx > 0$).\n        *   Let's check option A: $dy/dx = -x/2$. If $x<0$, then $-x/2$ will be positive (e.g., if $x=-2$, $dy/dx = -(-2)/2 = 1$). This matches the observation.\n\n4.  **Confirm with specific points (optional but good practice):**\n    *   Consider a point like $(2,0)$. From the graph, the slope is clearly negative and quite steep. For option A, $dy/dx = -2/2 = -1$. This corresponds to a line segment with a slope of $-1$, which visually matches the steep downward slope at $x=2$.\n    *   Consider a point like $(-2,0)$. From the graph, the slope is clearly positive and quite steep. For option A, $dy/dx = -(-2)/2 = 1$. This corresponds to a line segment with a slope of $1$, which visually matches the steep upward slope at $x=-2$.\n\nBased on all these checks, only option A, $dy/dx = -x/2$, is consistent with the given slope field.\n\nKey HSC Concepts used:\n*   **Slope Field Interpretation:** Understanding that each segment in a slope field represents the value of $dy/dx$ at that specific point $(x,y)$.\n*   **Differential Equation Properties:** Recognizing how the form of a differential equation (e.g., $dy/dx = f(x)$ vs $dy/dx = f(y)$) dictates the patterns in its slope field (e.g., slopes constant along vertical vs. horizontal lines).\n*   **Testing Points and Regions:** Systematically evaluating the differential equation options by checking the slope values at critical points (like axes) and in different quadrants/regions to confirm the match with the visual representation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.",
  "Others": "When tackling slope field questions in the HSC, always start by looking for general patterns before diving into specific calculations. Key patterns to observe include:\n\n1.  **Dependencies:** Does the slope $dy/dx$ appear to depend only on $x$, only on $y$, or on both? This is the quickest way to eliminate options.\n    *   If slopes are the same on vertical lines, $dy/dx = f(x)$.\n    *   If slopes are the same on horizontal lines, $dy/dx = f(y)$.\n2.  **Zeros and Undefined Slopes:** Where are the slopes horizontal ($dy/dx = 0$) or vertical ($dy/dx$ undefined)? This often happens along the axes or specific lines.\n3.  **Sign of Slopes:** In which quadrants or regions are the slopes positive, negative, or zero? This helps to narrow down options that might share similar zero-slope conditions.\n4.  **Magnitude of Slopes:** How steep are the slopes as $x$ or $y$ increase? This can differentiate between options like $x/2$ and $2x$.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently break down the problem and identify the correct differential equation. Drawing a small sketch of the expected slope field for each option can also be a helpful visual aid."
