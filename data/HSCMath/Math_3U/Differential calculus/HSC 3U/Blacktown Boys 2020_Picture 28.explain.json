  "Detailed_Explanation": "This is a classic related rates problem, combining geometry and differential calculus. It's often encountered in HSC Mathematics Extension 1.\n\n**Part (i): Show that $V = 1200h^2$**\n\n1.  **Identify the Shape and Dimensions:** The trough is a triangular prism. Its dimensions are given in a mix of metres and centimetres. The final volume formula and the rate of change are in $cm^3$ and $cm/s$, so it's crucial to convert all dimensions to centimetres first.\n    *   Length of trough ($L$): $4$ metres $= 4 \times 100 = 400$ cm.\n    *   Top width of the triangular end ($B$): $1.5$ metres $= 1.5 \times 100 = 150$ cm.\n    *   Total vertical height of the triangular end ($H$): $25$ cm.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Volume of Water:** The water in the trough also forms a smaller triangular prism. Let the depth of the water be $h$ cm and the width of the water surface be $x$ cm. The length of the water prism is the same as the trough, $L = 400$ cm.\n    The volume ($V$) of a triangular prism is given by: $V = (\\text{Area of triangular cross-section}) \\times \\text{Length}$.\n    The triangular cross-section of the water has a base $x$ and height $h$.\n    Area of water cross-section $= \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} x h$.\n    So, $V = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} x h \\right) \\times 400 = 200xh$.\n\n3.  **Use Similar Triangles to Relate $x$ and $h$:** The triangular cross-section of the water is similar to the triangular cross-section of the entire trough. This is the key geometric step.\n    *   For the full trough: Base $B = 150$ cm, Height $H = 25$ cm.\n    *   For the water: Base $x$ cm, Height $h$ cm.\n    The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal:\n    $\\frac{\\text{Base of water triangle}}{\\text{Height of water triangle}} = \\frac{\\text{Base of full trough triangle}}{\\text{Height of full trough triangle}}$\n    $\\frac{x}{h} = \\frac{150}{25}$\n    Simplify the ratio: $\\frac{150}{25} = 6$.\n    So, $\\frac{x}{h} = 6 \\implies x = 6h$.\n\n4.  **Substitute to Get $V$ in terms of $h$:** Substitute the expression for $x$ ($x=6h$) into the volume formula derived in step 2:\n    $V = 200 (6h) h$\n    $V = 1200h^2$.\n    This matches the expression required to be shown.\n\n**Part (ii): Find the rate at which the depth of water is changing when $h = 20$ cm.**\n\n1.  **Identify Given Rates and Required Rate:**\n    *   The trough is being emptied at $18000$ $cm^3$ per second. Since it's emptying, the volume is decreasing, so the rate of change of volume with respect to time, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$, is negative.\n        $\\frac{dV}{dt} = -18000$ $cm^3/s$.\n    *   We need to find the rate at which the depth of water is changing, which is $\\frac{dh}{dt}$, when $h = 20$ cm.\n\n2.  **Differentiate the Volume Formula:** We have $V = 1200h^2$. To use the chain rule, we first need to find the derivative of $V$ with respect to $h$.\n    $\\frac{dV}{dh} = \\frac{d}{dh}(1200h^2) = 1200 \\times 2h = 2400h$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Chain Rule:** The chain rule connects the rates of change:\n    $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dh} \\times \\frac{dh}{dt}$.\n\n4.  **Substitute Known Values and Solve for $\\frac{dh}{dt}$:**\n    Substitute $\\frac{dV}{dt} = -18000$ and $\\frac{dV}{dh} = 2400h$ into the chain rule equation:\n    $-18000 = (2400h) \\times \\frac{dh}{dt}$.\n    Rearrange to solve for $\\frac{dh}{dt}$:\n    $\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{-18000}{2400h}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate $\\frac{dh}{dt}$ at the Specific Depth:** The question asks for the rate when $h = 20$ cm. Substitute $h=20$ into the expression for $\\frac{dh}{dt}$:\n    $\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{-18000}{2400 \\times 20}$\n    $\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{-18000}{48000}$\n    Simplify the fraction:\n    $\\frac{dh}{dt} = -\\frac{18}{48} = -\\frac{3}{8}$ (by dividing numerator and denominator by 6)\n    As a decimal: $\\frac{dh}{dt} = -0.375$ cm/s.\n\n    The negative sign indicates that the depth of the water is decreasing, which is consistent with the trough being emptied. The rate of change of depth is $0.375$ cm/s downwards.\n\n**Key HSC Concepts Used:**\n\n*   **Volume of a Prism:** Understanding the formula for a triangular prism.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Essential for consistency in calculations.\n*   **Similar Triangles:** A fundamental geometric concept used to establish a relationship between varying dimensions ($x$ and $h$).\n*   **Related Rates (Chain Rule):** Applying the chain rule to link different rates of change with respect to time ($\\frac{dV}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dh}{dt}$). This is a core concept in differential calculus for HSC Extension 1.\n*   **Differentiation:** Correctly differentiating polynomial functions.\n*   **Problem-Solving Strategy:** Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable steps (geometry first, then calculus).\n\nThis question effectively tests a student's ability to integrate geometric understanding with calculus principles.",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I'd highlight several important points for students tackling this type of problem:\n\n1.  **Units, Units, Units!** This is the most common error. The question mixes metres and centimetres. Always convert everything to a consistent unit system at the very beginning. Here, cm and $cm^3$ are appropriate because the volume rate is given in $cm^3/s$ and depth in cm.\n\n2.  **Visualisation and Diagram:** The provided diagram is excellent, but for similar triangles, it's often helpful to sketch the 2D cross-section separately. Clearly label the full trough's dimensions ($B, H$) and the water's dimensions ($x, h$). This helps in setting up the similar triangles ratio correctly.\n\n3.  **Similar Triangles - The Geometric Bridge:** This is the non-calculus prerequisite. Students must accurately establish the relationship between the width ($x$) and depth ($h$) of the water. An incorrect relationship here will propagate errors through the entire calculus part. Remember the ratio: (small base / small height) = (large base / large height).\n\n4.  **Chain Rule Mastery:** The core of related rates problems lies in correctly applying the chain rule: $\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{dA}{dB} \\times \\frac{dB}{dt}$. Students often mix up variables or differentiate too early. Differentiate the volume formula ($V$ in terms of $h$) with respect to $h$ *first*, then apply the chain rule to bring in the time component.\n\n5.  **Sign Convention:** Pay close attention to whether quantities are increasing or decreasing. 'Emptied' means the volume is decreasing, so $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ must be negative. If the depth is decreasing, $\\frac{dh}{dt}$ should also be negative. This helps check the reasonableness of the final answer.\n\n6.  **Substitution Order:** Do NOT substitute numerical values (like $h=20$) into the equations *before* differentiation. The values of $x$ and $h$ are instantaneous. The derivative represents the general rate of change. Substitute the specific value of $h$ *only after* you have derived the expression for $\\frac{dh}{dt}$.\n\n7.  **Presentation:** Show all steps clearly. State your formula, show the differentiation, state the chain rule, substitute values, and provide the final answer with correct units. This is crucial for earning full marks in HSC exams, even if minor calculation errors occur.\n\nThis question is a good test of a student's ability to link different mathematical topics and execute a multi-step solution methodically."
