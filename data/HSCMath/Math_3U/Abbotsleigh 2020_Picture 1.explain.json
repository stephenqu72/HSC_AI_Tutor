  "Detailed_Explanation": "This problem involves permutations with a restriction, a common topic in HSC Mathematics Extension 1. The key concept here is to treat the group of items that must stay together as a single unit.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the groups and the restriction:**\n    *   We have 5 boys and 3 girls.\n    *   The restriction is that 'the girls all stand next to each other'.\n\n2.  **Treat the restricted group as a single unit:**\n    *   Since the 3 girls must stand together, we can imagine them as a single 'block' or 'super-person'. Let's call this block 'GGG'.\n\n3.  **Determine the total number of 'units' to arrange:**\n    *   We now have 5 individual boys (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5) and 1 'girls block' (GGG).\n    *   So, we are arranging 5 + 1 = 6 distinct units.\n\n4.  **Calculate the permutations of these units:**\n    *   The number of ways to arrange these 6 units in a queue is 6! (6 factorial).\n    *   6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720 ways.\n\n5.  **Calculate the permutations within the restricted group:**\n    *   Inside the 'GGG' block, the 3 girls can arrange themselves in any order. Since there are 3 distinct girls, they can be arranged in 3! (3 factorial) ways.\n    *   3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\n6.  **Multiply the permutations:**\n    *   For every arrangement of the 6 units, there are 6 ways for the girls to be arranged amongst themselves within their block.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of different ways is the product of the permutations from step 4 and step 5.\n    *   Total ways = (Arrangement of units) × (Arrangement of girls within their block)\n    *   Total ways = 6! × 3!\n    *   Total ways = 720 × 6\n    *   Total ways = 4320\n\nThus, there are 4320 different ways for 5 boys and 3 girls to stand in a queue if the girls all stand next to each other.",
  "Others": "From an HSC teacher's perspective, this is a classic permutation question that tests the understanding of 'objects together' or 'fixed block' problems. Students often forget to multiply by the internal permutations of the objects within the block. A common mistake would be to only calculate 6! (720), which is option B, or to incorrectly sum permutations. This question is a good indicator of whether a student fully grasps the concept of permutations with constraints. Always encourage students to break down these problems into two distinct parts: arranging the 'blocks' and arranging the 'items within the blocks'. Practicing similar problems with different numbers of items and different constraints (e.g., specific people *not* standing next to each other) is crucial for success in HSC Extension 1."
