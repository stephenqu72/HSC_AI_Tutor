  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question tests your understanding of vector addition and subtraction using the triangle rule. The key is to correctly interpret the directions of the vectors $\\mathbf{v_1}$ and $\\mathbf{v_2}$ relative to the original vector $\\mathbf{v}$.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n1.  **Vector Addition (Triangle Rule):** If you place vectors head-to-tail, their sum is the vector from the tail of the first to the head of the last. For instance, if vector $\\mathbf{A}$ is followed by vector $\\mathbf{B}$, their resultant is $\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}$.\n2.  **Vector Subtraction:** Vector subtraction $\\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{B}$ can be thought of as adding the negative of a vector: $\\mathbf{A} + (-\\mathbf{B})$. The negative of a vector, $-\\mathbf{B}$, has the same magnitude as $\\mathbf{B}$ but points in the opposite direction.\n3.  **Parallel and Equal Length Vectors:** If vector $\\mathbf{X}$ is parallel to vector $\\mathbf{Y}$ and has the same length, then $\\mathbf{X}$ can either be $\\mathbf{Y}$ (same direction) or $-\\mathbf{Y}$ (opposite direction). The diagram's arrows are crucial for determining the correct direction.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Part 1: Determining $\\mathbf{r_1}$**\n1.  **Identify the path:** Look at the vectors forming $\\mathbf{r_1}$. Vector $\\mathbf{u}$ starts from the origin. The dashed vector labeled $\\mathbf{v_1}$ starts from the head of $\\mathbf{u}$ and ends at the head of $\\mathbf{r_1}$. Vector $\\mathbf{r_1}$ itself starts from the origin and ends at the head of $\\mathbf{v_1}$.\n2.  **Apply the Triangle Rule:** According to the triangle rule of vector addition, if $\\mathbf{u}$ is followed by $\\mathbf{v_1}$, their resultant is $\\mathbf{r_1}$. So, $\\mathbf{r_1} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v_1}$.\n3.  **Determine $\\mathbf{v_1}$ in terms of $\\mathbf{v}$:** The problem states that $\\mathbf{v_1}$ is parallel to and equal in length to $\\mathbf{v}$. Observe the diagram: the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ points downwards and to the right. The dashed vector $\\mathbf{v_1}$ also points downwards and to the right. Since they have the same direction and magnitude, $\\mathbf{v_1} = \\mathbf{v}$.\n4.  **Substitute:** Substituting $\\mathbf{v_1} = \\mathbf{v}$ into the equation from step 2, we get $\\mathbf{r_1} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determining $\\mathbf{r_2}$**\n1.  **Identify the path:** Look at the vectors forming $\\mathbf{r_2}$. Vector $\\mathbf{r_2}$ starts from the origin. The dashed vector labeled $\\mathbf{v_2}$ starts from the head of $\\mathbf{r_2}$ and ends at the head of $\\mathbf{u}$. Vector $\\mathbf{u}$ itself starts from the origin and ends at the head of $\\mathbf{v_2}$.\n2.  **Apply the Triangle Rule:** Following the head-to-tail arrangement, if $\\mathbf{r_2}$ is followed by $\\mathbf{v_2}$, their resultant is $\\mathbf{u}$. So, $\\mathbf{r_2} + \\mathbf{v_2} = \\mathbf{u}$.\n3.  **Determine $\\mathbf{v_2}$ in terms of $\\mathbf{v}$:** The problem states that $\\mathbf{v_2}$ is parallel to and equal in length to $\\mathbf{v}$. Observe the diagram: the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ points downwards and to the right. The dashed vector $\\mathbf{v_2}$ (from the head of $\\mathbf{r_2}$ to the head of $\\mathbf{u}$) also points downwards and to the right. Since they have the same direction and magnitude, $\\mathbf{v_2} = \\mathbf{v}$.\n4.  **Substitute and Rearrange:** Substituting $\\mathbf{v_2} = \\mathbf{v}$ into the equation from step 2, we get $\\mathbf{r_2} + \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u}$. To solve for $\\mathbf{r_2}$, rearrange the equation: $\\mathbf{r_2} = \\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have found that $\\mathbf{r_1} = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{r_2} = \\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}$. Comparing these results with the given options, option D matches perfectly.",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I often see students make mistakes in two main areas with vector diagrams:\n1.  **Misinterpreting arrow directions:** Always pay close attention to which way the arrows are pointing. This determines the positive or negative sense of the vector. For example, if a vector is parallel to $\\mathbf{v}$ but points the other way, it's $-\\mathbf{v}$.\n2.  **Incorrectly applying the triangle rule:** Remember that vectors must be added head-to-tail. If they are arranged tail-to-tail (like $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ from the origin), their sum is the diagonal of the parallelogram they form (parallelogram rule), and their difference starts from the head of one to the head of the other, depending on which is subtracted. In this problem, $\\mathbf{v_1}$ and $\\mathbf{v_2}$ are specifically drawn in a way that encourages the triangle rule for addition/subtraction. Always draw or visualize the missing vector to form a closed triangle if you're stuck.\n\nThis question is a fundamental test of vector understanding and is a common style in the HSC Mathematics Extension 1 course. Practise similar problems to solidify these concepts!"
