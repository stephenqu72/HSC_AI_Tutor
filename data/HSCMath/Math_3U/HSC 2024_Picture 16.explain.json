  "Answer": "To show that the rate of increase of the radius, $\\frac{dr}{dt}$, is given by $\\frac{5}{2\\pi r^2} \\text{ cm s}^{-1}$, we start with the volume formula for a sphere, $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$. We differentiate this with respect to time, $t$, using the chain rule, which yields $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dr} \\times \\frac{dr}{dt}$.\n\nFirst, we find $\\frac{dV}{dr}$:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot 3r^2 = 4\\pi r^2 $$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the chain rule expression:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = (4\\pi r^2) \\frac{dr}{dt} $$\n\nThe problem states that the volume of the sphere is increasing at a rate of $10 \\text{ cm}^3 \\text{s}^{-1}$, so $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 10$. Substitute this value into the equation:\n$$ 10 = 4\\pi r^2 \\frac{dr}{dt} $$\n\nFinally, rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{dr}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{10}{4\\pi r^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{5}{2\\pi r^2} \\text{ cm s}^{-1} $$\nThis matches the expression required to be shown.",

  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question is a classic example of 'related rates of change' problems in HSC Mathematics Extension 1 and 2. It requires the application of differentiation, specifically the chain rule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given information and the goal.**\n*   We are given the formula for the volume of a sphere: $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n*   We are given the rate at which the volume is increasing: $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 10 \\text{ cm}^3 \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n*   Our goal is to *show that* the rate of increase of the radius is $\\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{5}{2\\pi r^2} \\text{ cm s}^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the variables using the chain rule.**\nSince $V$ is a function of $r$, and $r$ is a function of $t$ (as the radius is changing over time), we can relate the rates of change $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dr} \\times \\frac{dr}{dt} $$\nThis is the fundamental principle for solving related rates problems. It allows us to differentiate a variable with respect to time, even if it's explicitly defined in terms of another variable.\n\n**Step 3: Differentiate the volume formula with respect to $r$.**\nWe need to find $\\frac{dV}{dr}$ from the given volume formula $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\nTreat $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ as a constant coefficient and differentiate $r^3$ using the power rule $(\\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1})$:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dr} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot (3r^{3-1}) $$\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dr} = 4\\pi r^2 $$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the expressions into the chain rule equation.**\nNow we have $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 10$ and $\\frac{dV}{dr} = 4\\pi r^2$. Substitute these into the chain rule equation:\n$$ 10 = (4\\pi r^2) \\frac{dr}{dt} $$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for $\\frac{dr}{dt}$.**\nTo isolate $\\frac{dr}{dt}$, divide both sides of the equation by $4\\pi r^2$:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{10}{4\\pi r^2} $$\nSimplify the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{5}{2\\pi r^2} $$\n\n**Step 6: Add units.**\nThe radius $r$ is in cm, and time $t$ is in s, so the rate of change of radius $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ will have units of $\\text{cm s}^{-1}$.\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{5}{2\\pi r^2} \\text{ cm s}^{-1} $$\nThis matches the expression we were asked to show.\n\nThe plot code shows conceptually how $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ decreases as $r$ increases, which makes intuitive sense: as the sphere gets larger, the same increase in volume will result in a smaller increase in radius.",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I'd emphasize the following points for students tackling 'related rates of change' problems:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chain Rule:** This is the absolute cornerstone of related rates. Ensure you can confidently apply $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\times \\frac{du}{dx}$ or, in this context, $\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{dA}{dx} \\times \\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n2.  **Identify Variables and Rates:** Clearly list what's given ($\frac{dV}{dt}$, $V$ formula) and what needs to be found ($\frac{dr}{dt}$). Pay attention to units as they can often guide you.\n3.  **Draw a Diagram (if applicable):** For more complex geometry problems (e.g., cones, cylinders, ladders sliding down a wall), a diagram is crucial for identifying relationships between variables.\n4.  **Implicit Differentiation with Respect to Time:** Remember that when you differentiate an equation involving geometric variables (like $V$ or $r$) with respect to *time* ($t$), you must apply the chain rule. For example, $\\frac{d}{dt}(r^3) = 3r^2 \\frac{dr}{dt}$, not just $3r^2$.\n5.  **'Show That' Questions:** For 'show that' questions, ensure every step is logical and clearly presented. You must arrive at the given expression, demonstrating the derivation fully.\n6.  **Common Errors:** Students often forget the $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ (or $\frac{dr}{dt}$) term after differentiating a variable with respect to $t$. Also, algebraic manipulation errors when rearranging the formula are common. Double-check your work!\n7.  **Conceptual Understanding:** Think about what the rates mean. If volume is increasing at a constant rate, why would the radius's rate of increase decrease as the radius grows? Because a larger sphere requires a smaller change in radius for the same change in volume (think of adding a thin layer of paint to a small ball vs. a large ball).\n\nThis question is worth 2 marks, which usually means it's a straightforward application of the chain rule. Ensure your working is clear and concise to earn full marks."
