  "Detailed_Explanation": "The question asks for the total area of the shaded regions between the functions $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$. In calculus, the total area between two curves is found by integrating the absolute difference between the functions over the given interval. That is, Area = $\\int_{a}^{b} |f(x) - g(x)| dx$.\n\nWhen calculating the total area, it's crucial to identify the intervals where each function is 'on top' (i.e., has a greater y-value). If $f(x) \\ge g(x)$ over an interval, the area contribution is $\\int (f(x) - g(x)) dx$. If $g(x) \\ge f(x)$ over an interval, the area contribution is $\\int (g(x) - f(x)) dx$, which is equivalent to $-\\int (f(x) - g(x)) dx$.\n\nLet's analyze the given diagram and the intersection points:\n1.  **Intersection points:** The functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ intersect at $x = -3$, $x = -1$, and $x = 1$. These points divide the overall interval $[-4, 4]$ into four sub-intervals.\n2.  **Interval $[-4, -3]$:** In this region, the curve $y=g(x)$ is above $y=f(x)$. Therefore, the area contribution is $\\int_{-4}^{-3} (g(x) - f(x)) dx$. This can also be written as $-\\int_{-4}^{-3} (f(x) - g(x)) dx$.\n3.  **Interval $[-3, -1]$:** In this region, the curve $y=f(x)$ is above $y=g(x)$. Therefore, the area contribution is $\\int_{-3}^{-1} (f(x) - g(x)) dx$.\n4.  **Interval $[-1, 1]$:** In this region, the curve $y=g(x)$ is above $y=f(x)$. Therefore, the area contribution is $\\int_{-1}^{1} (g(x) - f(x)) dx$. This can also be written as $-\\int_{-1}^{1} (f(x) - g(x)) dx$.\n5.  **Interval $[1, 4]$:** In this region, the curve $y=f(x)$ is above $y=g(x)$. Therefore, the area contribution is $\\int_{1}^{4} (f(x) - g(x)) dx$.\n\nTo find the total area, we sum these positive area contributions:\nTotal Area $= \\left( -\\int_{-4}^{-3} (f(x) - g(x)) dx \\right) + \\left( \\int_{-3}^{-1} (f(x) - g(x)) dx \\right) + \\left( -\\int_{-1}^{1} (f(x) - g(x)) dx \\right) + \\left( \\int_{1}^{4} (f(x) - g(x)) dx \\right)$.\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n*   **A. $\\int_{-4}^{4} (f(x) - g(x)) dx$**: This calculates the *net signed area*. It would treat areas where $g(x)$ is above $f(x)$ (i.e., $f(x) - g(x)$ is negative) as negative contributions, leading to cancellation and not the total absolute area.\n*   **B. $\\left| \\int_{-4}^{4} (f(x) - g(x)) dx \\right|$**: This calculates the absolute value of the net signed area. This is also incorrect. For instance, if there are equal positive and negative signed areas, the net signed area could be zero, but the total area would be non-zero.\n*   **C. $\\int_{-4}^{-3} (f(x) - g(x)) dx + \\int_{-3}^{-1} (f(x) - g(x)) dx + \\int_{-1}^{1} (f(x) - g(x)) dx + \\int_{1}^{4} (f(x) - g(x)) dx$**: This is equivalent to option A, simply broken down by intervals. It still calculates the net signed area, as it doesn't account for the sign change required for total area.\n*   **D. $-\\int_{-4}^{-3} (f(x) - g(x)) dx + \\int_{-3}^{-1} (f(x) - g(x)) dx - \\int_{-1}^{1} (f(x) - g(x)) dx + \\int_{1}^{4} (f(x) - g(x)) dx$**: This option perfectly matches our derived expression for the total area. The negative signs in front of the integrals for intervals $[-4, -3]$ and $[-1, 1]$ correctly turn the negative $(f(x)-g(x))$ values into positive area contributions, because $-(f(x)-g(x)) = g(x)-f(x)$.\n\nThus, option D correctly represents the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\\boxed{D}$",
