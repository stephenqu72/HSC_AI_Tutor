  "Detailed_Explanation": "This problem tests your understanding of finding points of intersection between curves and calculating the area enclosed by them using definite integration. It's a common type of question in the HSC Mathematics Extension 1 or Advanced course.\n\n**Part (a): Find the x-coordinates of the points of intersection of the two curves.**\n1.  **Set the equations equal:** To find where the curves intersect, their y-values must be the same. So, we set the two given equations equal to each other:\n    $(x - 1)^2 = 5 - x^2$\n\n2.  **Expand and rearrange:** Expand the left side and move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n    $x^2 - 2x + 1 = 5 - x^2$\n    $x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 - 5 = 0$\n    $2x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$\n\n3.  **Simplify the quadratic equation:** Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n    $x^2 - x - 2 = 0$\n\n4.  **Solve the quadratic equation:** Factorize the quadratic equation to find the values of x:\n    $(x - 2)(x + 1) = 0$\n    This gives two possible solutions for x:\n    $x = 2$ or $x = -1$\n\n    These are the x-coordinates of the points where the two curves intersect.\n\n**Part (b): Find the area enclosed by the two curves.**\n1.  **Identify the upper and lower curves:** To calculate the area between two curves, $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$, we use the formula $Area = \\int_{a}^{b} (f(x) - g(x)) dx$, where $f(x)$ is the upper curve and $g(x)$ is the lower curve in the interval $[a, b]$.\n    Let $f(x) = 5 - x^2$ (downward opening parabola) and $g(x) = (x - 1)^2$ (upward opening parabola).\n    We need to determine which curve is above the other in the interval $[-1, 2]$. A simple way is to pick a test point within the interval, e.g., $x=0$:\n    For $f(x)$: $y = 5 - 0^2 = 5$\n    For $g(x)$: $y = (0 - 1)^2 = 1$\n    Since $5 > 1$, $f(x) = 5 - x^2$ is the upper curve and $g(x) = (x - 1)^2$ is the lower curve in the interval $[-1, 2]$.\n\n2.  **Set up the definite integral:** The limits of integration are the x-coordinates of the intersection points found in part (a), so $a = -1$ and $b = 2$. The integrand will be the upper curve minus the lower curve:\n    $Area = \\int_{-1}^{2} \\left( (5 - x^2) - (x - 1)^2 \\right) dx$\n\n3.  **Simplify the integrand:**\n    $Area = \\int_{-1}^{2} \\left( 5 - x^2 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) \\right) dx$\n    $Area = \\int_{-1}^{2} \\left( 5 - x^2 - x^2 + 2x - 1 \\right) dx$\n    $Area = \\int_{-1}^{2} \\left( -2x^2 + 2x + 4 \\right) dx$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the definite integral:** Find the antiderivative of the integrand and evaluate it at the limits.\n    Antiderivative: $P(x) = -2\\frac{x^3}{3} + 2\\frac{x^2}{2} + 4x = -\\frac{2}{3}x^3 + x^2 + 4x$\n\n    Now, apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: $P(b) - P(a)$\n    $Area = P(2) - P(-1)$\n    $P(2) = -\\frac{2}{3}(2)^3 + (2)^2 + 4(2) = -\\frac{2}{3}(8) + 4 + 8 = -\\frac{16}{3} + 12 = -\\frac{16}{3} + \\frac{36}{3} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n    $P(-1) = -\\frac{2}{3}(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 + 4(-1) = -\\frac{2}{3}(-1) + 1 - 4 = \\frac{2}{3} - 3 = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{9}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3}$\n\n    $Area = \\frac{20}{3} - \\left( -\\frac{7}{3} \\right) = \\frac{20}{3} + \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{27}{3} = 9$\n\nThe area enclosed by the two curves is 9 square units.",
  "Others": "This is a standard HSC question on applications of integration. Students must be proficient in:\n1.  **Algebraic manipulation:** Expanding quadratics, solving quadratic equations, and simplifying expressions.\n2.  **Calculus fundamentals:** Correctly setting up definite integrals for area between curves, finding antiderivatives of polynomial functions, and evaluating definite integrals.\n3.  **Understanding the 'upper minus lower' concept:** It's crucial to correctly identify which function is greater over the interval of integration. A common mistake is to simply integrate the absolute difference, but a more direct approach for polynomial functions is to test a point or sketch the graphs.\n4.  **Care with negative signs and fractions:** Errors in arithmetic, especially with negative numbers and fractions, are common. Encourage students to show all steps clearly and double-check calculations, particularly when substituting limits into the antiderivative.\n\nFor part (a), only one mark is allocated, so a clear solution to the quadratic equation is sufficient. For part (b), the three marks will typically be distributed for the correct integral setup (1 mark), correct integration (1 mark), and correct evaluation of the definite integral (1 mark). Always include units (square units) for area questions, even if not explicitly asked, as it demonstrates a complete understanding."
