  "Detailed_Explanation": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the combined mean of two groups. The combined mean is given by the total sum of the marks of all students divided by the total number of students. Let's denote the mean of Juliana's class as \\( M_J \\). The formula for the combined mean \\( M_C \\) is given by:\n\n$$ M_C = \frac{(M_A \times N_A) + (M_J \times N_J)}{N_A + N_J} $$\n\nWhere,\n- \\( M_C \\) is the combined mean,\n- \\( M_A \\) is the mean of Andy's class,\n- \\( N_A \\) is the number of students in Andy's class,\n- \\( M_J \\) is the mean of Juliana's class,\n- \\( N_J \\) is the number of students in Juliana's class.\n\nGiven values are,\n- \\( M_A = 65\\% \\),\n- \\( N_A = 16 \\),\n- \\( N_J = 24 \\),\n- \\( M_C = 68.6\\% \\).\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$ 68.6 = \frac{(65 \times 16) + (M_J \times 24)}{16 + 24} $$\n\nSolving for \\( M_J \\):\n\n$$ 68.6 = \frac{1040 + 24M_J}{40} $$\n\n$$ 68.6 \times 40 = 1040 + 24M_J $$\n\n$$ 2744 = 1040 + 24M_J $$\n\n$$ 2744 - 1040 = 24M_J $$\n\n$$ 1704 = 24M_J $$\n\n$$ M_J = \frac{1704}{24} $$\n\n$$ M_J = 71 $$\n\nTherefore, the mean for Juliana's class is 70.5%.",
  "Others": "This problem involves the application of the combined mean formula, which is a fundamental concept in statistics. It is important to ensure that the units of measurement are consistent and that the total number of students is correctly accounted for in the calculation."
