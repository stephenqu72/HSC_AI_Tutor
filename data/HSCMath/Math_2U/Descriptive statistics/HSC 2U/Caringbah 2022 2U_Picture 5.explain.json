  "Detailed_Explanation": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mean, mode, and median of the given data set and then compare them. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Mean Calculation**: The mean is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values. The formula is: \\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Frequency} \\times \\text{Correct Questions})}{\\sum \\text{Frequency}} \\]\n\n2. **Mode Calculation**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. From the frequency table, we can see that the mode is 7 because it has the highest frequency (8).\n\n3. **Median Calculation**: The median is the middle value when the data set is ordered. Since there are 30 values (sum of frequencies), the median will be the average of the 15th and 16th values. By looking at the cumulative frequency, we can see that the 15th and 16th values are both 7, so the median is 7.\n\n4. **Comparison**: Now, we need to calculate the mean and compare it with the mode and median. The mean is calculated as follows: \\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{3 \\times 1 + 5 \\times 3 + 6 \\times 4 + 7 \\times 8 + 8 \\times 4 + 9 \\times 3 + 10 \\times 2}{1 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 2} = \\frac{3 + 15 + 24 + 56 + 32 + 27 + 20}{30} = \\frac{175}{30} = 5.8333 \\]\n\nSo, the mean is approximately 5.83, the mode is 7, and the median is 7. Therefore, the correct statement is: Mean > Mode > Median.",
  "Others": "This problem tests the understanding of basic statistical measures and their calculation. It's important to note that the mode and median are both 7 in this case, which simplifies the comparison. The mean, however, is less than both the mode and median, making the correct statement 'Mean > Mode > Median'."
