  "Answer": "The bottle is 12 mL below the mean of 300 mL, as the z-score of -1.2 corresponds to 12 mL below the mean in a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 10 mL. For part b), the label should show a minimum of 300 mL to ensure that at least 97.5% of bottles contain more liquid than indicated on the label.",

  "Detailed_Explanation": "### Part a)\n\nThe z-score formula is given by:\n$$ z = \frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\nwhere $X$ is the value of the variable, $\\mu$ is the mean, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation. Given $z = -1.2$, $\\mu = 300$ mL, and $\\sigma = 10$ mL, we can solve for $X$:\n$$ -1.2 = \frac{X - 300}{10} $$\nMultiplying both sides by 10 gives:\n$$ -12 = X - 300 $$\nAdding 300 to both sides gives:\n$$ X = 288 $$\nThus, the bottle is $300 - 288 = 12$ mL below the mean.\n\n### Part b)\n\nTo find the minimum amount of liquid that should be labeled to ensure that at least 97.5% of bottles contain more liquid, we need to find the value of $X$ such that the z-score is at the 2.5th percentile (since 97.5% of the data is above this point). The z-score corresponding to the 2.5th percentile is approximately -1.96. Using the z-score formula again:\n$$ -1.96 = \frac{X - 300}{10} $$\nSolving for $X$ gives:\n$$ X = 300 - 1.96 \times 10 = 300 - 19.6 = 280.4 $$\nThus, the label should show a minimum of 280.4 mL to ensure that at least 97.5% of bottles contain more liquid than indicated on the label.",
  "Others": "This question tests understanding of normal distribution properties and the use of z-scores to find specific values in a normal distribution. It is important to remember that the z-score table or a statistical calculator is often used to find the exact value for the 2.5th percentile."
