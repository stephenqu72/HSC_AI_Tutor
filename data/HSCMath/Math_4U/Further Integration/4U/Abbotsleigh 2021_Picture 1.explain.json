  "Detailed_Explanation": "This question requires us to work backwards from a partial fraction decomposition to find a missing coefficient in the original rational function. This is a common technique in HSC Mathematics Extension 1 and 2.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the premise.**\nWe are given that the integral $\\int \\frac{3x-A}{1-x^2} dx$ can be determined using the partial fractions $\\frac{-1}{1+x} + \\frac{2}{1-x}$. This implies that the original fraction $\\frac{3x-A}{1-x^2}$ is equivalent to the sum of these partial fractions.\n\n**Step 2: Combine the given partial fractions.**\nTo find the equivalent single fraction, we need to add the partial fractions together by finding a common denominator.\nThe denominators are $(1+x)$ and $(1-x)$. Their product, $(1+x)(1-x)$, is $1-x^2$, which is the denominator of the original fraction.\n\n$$ \\frac{-1}{1+x} + \\frac{2}{1-x} = \\frac{-1(1-x)}{(1+x)(1-x)} + \\frac{2(1+x)}{(1-x)(1+x)} $$ \n\n**Step 3: Simplify the expression.**\nNow, expand the numerators and combine them over the common denominator:\n\n$$ = \\frac{(-1+x) + (2+2x)}{1-x^2} $$ \n$$ = \\frac{-1+x+2+2x}{1-x^2} $$ \n$$ = \\frac{3x+1}{1-x^2} $$ \n\n**Step 4: Equate the combined fraction with the original fraction.**\nWe are given that $\\frac{3x-A}{1-x^2}$ is equal to the sum of the partial fractions. Therefore:\n\n$$ \\frac{3x-A}{1-x^2} = \\frac{3x+1}{1-x^2} $$ \n\n**Step 5: Compare the numerators to solve for A.**\nSince the denominators are identical, the numerators must also be identical for the fractions to be equal.\n\n$$ 3x-A = 3x+1 $$ \nSubtract $3x$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n$$ -A = 1 $$ \nMultiply both sides by $-1$:\n\n$$ A = -1 $$ \n\nTherefore, the value of $A$ is $-1$. This matches option B.",
  "Others": "This type of question is a fundamental application of partial fractions, often found in the early sections of Extension 1 or Extension 2 HSC exams. It tests your ability to reverse the partial fraction decomposition process. Students should be comfortable with:\n\n1.  **Factoring denominators:** Recognizing that $1-x^2$ is a difference of squares $(1-x)(1+x)$.\n2.  **Finding a common denominator:** The basic skill of adding fractions.\n3.  **Algebraic manipulation:** Expanding brackets and collecting like terms.\n4.  **Coefficient matching:** A crucial technique in partial fractions, where you equate coefficients of like powers of $x$ (or constant terms) on both sides of an identity.\n\nSometimes, instead of matching coefficients, you can use substitution (e.g., substitute $x=1$ or $x=-1$ into the equation $3x-A = -1(1-x) + 2(1+x)$ to quickly find the values of constants if they were unknown). While not strictly necessary here, it's a valuable alternative method to remember for more complex partial fraction problems or to check your work."
