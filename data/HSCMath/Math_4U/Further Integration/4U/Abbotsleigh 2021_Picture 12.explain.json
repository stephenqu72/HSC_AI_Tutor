  "Detailed_Explanation": "Here's a step-by-step breakdown for solving this integral, focusing on HSC concepts:\n\n**1. Identify the form of the integrand:**\n The integrand is a rational function $\\frac{1+x}{4+x^2}$. It's often helpful to look for ways to simplify or split such expressions, especially when the denominator is a quadratic with no real roots (like $4+x^2$).\n\n**2. Split the integral:**\n The most straightforward approach for an integrand of the form $\\frac{A+Bx}{C+Dx^2}$ is to split it into two fractions:\n $$ \\int \\frac{1+x}{4+x^2} dx = \\int \\left( \\frac{1}{4+x^2} + \\frac{x}{4+x^2} \\right) dx $$ \n This transforms the problem into finding two separate, simpler integrals:\n $$ I_1 = \\int \\frac{1}{4+x^2} dx $$ \n $$ I_2 = \\int \\frac{x}{4+x^2} dx $$ \n\n**3. Evaluate the first integral ($I_1$):**\n $I_1 = \\int \\frac{1}{4+x^2} dx$\n This is a standard integral form you should memorise or be able to derive from the HSC Mathematics Extension 1 syllabus. The general form is:\n $$ \\int \\frac{1}{a^2+x^2} dx = \\frac{1}{a} \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) + C $$ \n In our case, $a^2 = 4$, so $a = 2$. \n Substituting this value, we get:\n $$ I_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) $$ \n\n**4. Evaluate the second integral ($I_2$):**\n $I_2 = \\int \\frac{x}{4+x^2} dx$\n This integral suggests a substitution method because the numerator ($x$) is directly related to the derivative of the denominator ($4+x^2$).\n \n Let $u = 4+x^2$.\n Now, find $du/dx$:\n $$ \\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(4+x^2) = 2x $$ \n Rearrange to find $dx$ in terms of $du$ (or $x \\, dx$ in terms of $du$):\n $$ du = 2x \\, dx $$ \n $$ \\frac{1}{2} du = x \\, dx $$ \n Substitute $u$ and $x \\, dx$ into $I_2$:\n $$ I_2 = \\int \\frac{1}{u} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} du $$ \n Take the constant $\\frac{1}{2}$ outside the integral:\n $$ I_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\frac{1}{u} du $$ \n This is a standard integral:\n $$ \\int \\frac{1}{u} du = \\ln|u| + C $$ \n So,\n $$ I_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln|u| $$ \n Finally, substitute back $u = 4+x^2$:\n $$ I_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln|4+x^2| $$ \n Since $x^2 \\ge 0$, $4+x^2$ is always positive ($4+x^2 \\ge 4$). Therefore, we can remove the absolute value signs:\n $$ I_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4+x^2) $$ \n\n**5. Combine the results:**\n Add the results of $I_1$ and $I_2$ together, and don't forget the constant of integration, $C$, which represents the family of all antiderivatives.\n $$ \\int \\frac{1+x}{4+x^2} dx = I_1 + I_2 + C $$ \n $$ \\int \\frac{1+x}{4+x^2} dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4+x^2) + C $$",
  "Others": "This is a classic question that combines two essential integration techniques for the HSC Extension 1 syllabus: the inverse trigonometric integral form and integration by substitution leading to a logarithmic integral. \n\n**Key takeaways for HSC students:**\n1.  **Splitting Fractions:** Always consider splitting rational functions into simpler fractions, especially when the numerator is a sum/difference and the denominator is a quadratic or a single term. This is often the first step in problems involving combinations of standard integral forms.\n2.  **Standard Integral Forms:** You must be proficient with standard integral forms, including those for $\\tan^{-1}(x/a)$, $\\sin^{-1}(x/a)$, and $\\ln|f(x)|$ (from $f'(x)/f(x)$). These are provided on the reference sheet, but knowing them by heart saves time.\n3.  **Integration by Substitution:** Recognise when the numerator (or part of it) is a multiple of the derivative of the denominator. This is a strong indicator for using $u$-substitution, which typically leads to an integral of the form $\\int \\frac{1}{u} du$ or $\\int u^n du$.\n4.  **Constant of Integration:** Never forget to add the ' $+ C$' at the end of an indefinite integral. It's a common oversight that can cost marks.\n5.  **Absolute Value for Logarithms:** Remember that $\\int \\frac{1}{u} du = \\ln|u|$. Only remove the absolute value if you are certain that the expression inside the logarithm is always positive (as in this case, $4+x^2 > 0$).\n\nPractising these types of questions will build confidence and speed for the exam."
