  "Detailed_Explanation": "This problem requires us to evaluate an integral by first completing the square in the denominator. This is a common technique in HSC Mathematics Extension 1 and 2 when dealing with integrals that lead to inverse trigonometric functions.\n\n**Step 1: Complete the square for the quadratic expression in the denominator.**\nThe expression inside the square root is $6 - x^2 - x$. We need to rearrange this into the form $a^2 - (x-h)^2$ or $(x-h)^2 - a^2$. The presence of $6 - x^2$ suggests the $\\sin^{-1}$ form, which is $\\int \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 - u^2}} du$.\n\nLet's work with the quadratic term: $-(x^2 + x - 6)$.\nTo complete the square for $x^2 + x$, we take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is $1$), square it, and add/subtract it. Half of $1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and squaring it gives $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSo, $x^2 + x - 6 = (x^2 + x + \\frac{1}{4}) - \\frac{1}{4} - 6$\n$= \\left(x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{24}{4}$\n$= \\left(x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original expression:\n$6 - x^2 - x = -\\left[\\left(x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{4}\\right]$\n$= \\frac{25}{4} - \\left(x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the integral using the completed square form.**\nNow the integral becomes:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{4} - \\left(x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2}} dx $$\n\n**Step 3: Identify the standard integral form and apply it.**\nThis integral is in the standard form $\\int \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 - u^2}} du = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{u}{a}\\right) + C$.\n\nComparing our integral with the standard form:\n*   $a^2 = \\frac{25}{4} \\implies a = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{4}} = \\frac{5}{2}$\n*   $u^2 = \\left(x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\implies u = x + \\frac{1}{2}$\n*   The differential $du$ is $d\\left(x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = dx$, so no adjustment for $du$ is needed.\n\nApplying the standard integral formula:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{4} - \\left(x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2}} dx = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x + \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{5}{2}}\\right) + C $$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the argument of the inverse sine function.**\n$$ \\frac{x + \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{2x+1}{2}}{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{2x+1}{5} $$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n$$ \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2x+1}{5}\\right) + C $$.",
  "Others": "As an HSC teacher, I'd emphasise a few key points for students tackling this type of question:\n\n1.  **Read the Instruction Carefully:** The phrase \"By completing the square\" is crucial. You must show the completion of the square to earn full marks. Simply writing down the answer (even if correct) or using another method (if one existed, which isn't really the case here) would likely lead to loss of marks.\n2.  **Handling Negative Coefficients:** Be very careful when completing the square with a negative $x^2$ coefficient. It's often best to factor out the negative sign first: $6 - x^2 - x = 6 - (x^2 + x)$. Then complete the square for $x^2 + x$ and reintroduce the negative sign carefully.\n3.  **Standard Integral Forms:** You must be familiar with the common inverse trigonometric integral forms provided in the reference sheet. For this question, it's $\\int \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} dx = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) + C$. Make sure you can correctly identify 'a' and 'u' (or 'x' in the formula) from your completed square form.\n4.  **Arithmetic with Fractions:** Don't rush the arithmetic, especially when combining constants or simplifying the argument of the inverse sine function. A small error with fractions can lead to a wrong answer.\n5.  **Don't Forget +C:** Always remember to add the constant of integration, $C$, for indefinite integrals. It's an easy mark to lose!\n\nThis question is a good test of algebraic manipulation skills combined with knowledge of standard integral forms, making it a very common type of question in HSC exams."
