  "Detailed_Explanation": "This problem requires us to evaluate an indefinite integral involving powers of sine and cosine. The key strategy for integrals of the form $\\int \\sin^m x \\cos^n x \\, dx$ when at least one of $m$ or $n$ is odd is to 'save' one factor of the odd power and convert the remaining even power using the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$. Then, a simple substitution can be applied.\n\n**Step 1: Rewrite the integrand using a trigonometric identity.**\nWe have $\\int \\sin^3 x \\cos^3 x \\, dx$. Since both powers are odd, we can choose to save either a $\\sin x$ or a $\\cos x$. Let's choose to save a $\\cos x$ factor and rewrite $\\cos^2 x$ in terms of $\\sin x$. This will allow us to use the substitution $u = \\sin x$.\n\n$$ \\int \\sin^3 x \\cos^3 x \\, dx = \\int \\sin^3 x \\cos^2 x \\cdot \\cos x \\, dx $$ \nNow, use the Pythagorean identity $\\cos^2 x = 1 - \\sin^2 x$:\n$$ \\int \\sin^3 x (1 - \\sin^2 x) \\cos x \\, dx $$\n\n**Step 2: Apply substitution.**\nLet $u = \\sin x$. \nThen, the differential $du$ is $du = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin x) \\, dx = \\cos x \\, dx$.\n\nSubstitute $u$ and $du$ into the integral:\n$$ \\int u^3 (1 - u^2) \\, du $$\n\n**Step 3: Expand and integrate.**\nExpand the integrand:\n$$ \\int (u^3 - u^5) \\, du $$\nNow, integrate term by term using the power rule for integration, $\\int x^n \\, dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$:\n$$ \\frac{u^{3+1}}{3+1} - \\frac{u^{5+1}}{5+1} + C $$ \n$$ = \\frac{u^4}{4} - \\frac{u^6}{6} + C $$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute back for $x$.**\nFinally, replace $u$ with $\\sin x$ to express the result in terms of $x$:\n$$ \\frac{(\\sin x)^4}{4} - \\frac{(\\sin x)^6}{6} + C $$ \n$$ = \\frac{\\sin^4 x}{4} - \\frac{\\sin^6 x}{6} + C $$\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n*Alternatively, one could choose to substitute $u = \\cos x$. In that case, the integral would be rewritten as $\\int \\sin^2 x \\cos^3 x \\sin x \\, dx$, and $\\sin^2 x$ would be replaced with $1 - \\cos^2 x$. The result would be $\\frac{\\cos^6 x}{6} - \\frac{\\cos^4 x}{4} + C$, which is equivalent to the first answer, differing only by a constant.*",
  "Others": "This is a very common type of integration problem for HSC Mathematics Extension 1 students. It tests the understanding of trigonometric identities and the technique of substitution. Students should be comfortable with both possible substitutions ($u=\\sin x$ or $u=\\cos x$) when both powers are odd, as either choice leads to a correct solution. It's crucial to remember the constant of integration, $C$, for indefinite integrals. Missing $C$ usually results in a deduction of marks in HSC exams."
