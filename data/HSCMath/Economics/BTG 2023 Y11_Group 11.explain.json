  "Detailed_Explanation": "The question asks to determine the price elasticity of demand between $4.00 and $4.50 using the total outlay method. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Understand the Total Outlay Method**: This method relates changes in price to changes in total revenue (or total outlay for consumers). It doesn't require calculating the exact elasticity coefficient but rather determines if demand is elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic.\n    *   **Elastic Demand**: Price and total outlay move in opposite directions. (e.g., Price increases, Total Outlay decreases; or Price decreases, Total Outlay increases)\n    *   **Inelastic Demand**: Price and total outlay move in the same direction. (e.g., Price increases, Total Outlay increases; or Price decreases, Total Outlay decreases)\n    *   **Unit Elastic Demand**: Total outlay remains constant despite a change in price.\n\n2.  **Identify the relevant data points from the table**:\n    *   When Price (P1) = $4.00, Quantity Demanded (Q1) = 520 bottles.\n    *   When Price (P2) = $4.50, Quantity Demanded (Q2) = 500 bottles.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Outlay (Total Revenue) for each price point**: Total Outlay (TO) = Price × Quantity.\n    *   At P1 = $4.00: TO1 = $4.00 × 520 = $2080\n    *   At P2 = $4.50: TO2 = $4.50 × 500 = $2250\n\n4.  **Analyze the changes in Price and Total Outlay**: \n    *   **Price Change**: Price increased from $4.00 to $4.50.\n    *   **Total Outlay Change**: Total Outlay increased from $2080 to $2250.\n\n5.  **Apply the Total Outlay Method rule**: Both the Price and the Total Outlay increased. Since they moved in the *same direction*, the demand is **inelastic**.\n\nTherefore, the price elasticity of demand between $4.00 and $4.50 is relatively inelastic.",
  "Others": "As a top HSC teacher, remember that the total outlay method is a crucial qualitative way to assess price elasticity without complex calculations. It's often tested in multiple-choice questions. A common mistake is confusing the direction of movement for elastic vs. inelastic demand – always associate 'same direction' with inelastic and 'opposite direction' with elastic. It's also vital to clearly identify the initial and final price/quantity points for your calculation. Practice this method with different scenarios to solidify your understanding for the HSC Economics exam!"
